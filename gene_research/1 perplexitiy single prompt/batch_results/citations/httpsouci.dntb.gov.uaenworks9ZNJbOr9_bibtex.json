Bacillus subtilis sp subtilis strain 168 is the model Gram-positive bacteria and the list of the genes involved in tRNA modifications in this organism is far from complete. Mass spectrometry analysis of bulk tRNA extracted from B. subtilis, combined with next generation sequencing technologies and comparative genomic analyses, led to the identification of 41 tRNA modification genes with associated confidence scores. Many differences were found in this model Gram-positive bacteria when compared to E. coli. In general, B. subtilis tRNAs are less modified than those in E. coli, even if some modifications, such as m1A22 or ms2t6A, are only found in the model Gram-positive bacteria. Many examples of non-orthologous displacements and of variations in the most complex pathways are described. Paralog issues make uncertain direct annotation transfer from E. coli to B. subtilis based on homology only without further experimental validation. This difficulty was shown with the identification of the B. subtilis enzyme that introduces \u03c8 at positions 31/32 of the tRNAs. This work presents the most up to date list of tRNA modification genes in B. subtilis, identifies the gaps in knowledge, and lays the foundation for further work to decipher the physiological role of tRNA modifications in this important model organism and other bacteria.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10070977}\n}\n```"
