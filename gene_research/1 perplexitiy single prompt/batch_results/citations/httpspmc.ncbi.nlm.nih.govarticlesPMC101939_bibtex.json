The genes, rppA (sll0797) and rppB (sll0798), represent a two-component regulatory system that controls the synthesis of photosystem II (PSII) and PSI genes, in addition to photopigment-related genes. rppA (regulator of photosynthesis- and photopigment-related gene expression) and rppB exhibit strong sequence similarity to prokaryotic response regulators and histidine kinases, respectively. In the wild type, the steady-state mRNA levels of PSII reaction center genes increased when the plastoquinone (PQ) pool was oxidized and decreased when the PQ pool was reduced, whereas transcription of the PSI reaction center genes was affected in an opposite fashion. Such results suggested that the redox poise of the PQ pool is critical for regulation of the photosystem reaction center genes. In \u0394 rppA, an insertion mutation of rppA, the PSII gene transcripts were highly up-regulated relative to the wild type under all redox conditions, whereas transcription of phycobilisome-related genes and PSI genes was decreased. The higher transcription of the psbA gene in \u0394 rppA was manifest by higher translation of the D1 protein and a concomitant increase in O2 evolution. The results demonstrated that RppA is a regulator of photosynthesis- and photopigment-related gene expression, is involved in the establishment of the appropriate stoichiometry between the photosystems, and can sense changes in the PQ redox poise.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.182.15.4268-4277.2000}\n}\n```"
