The authors of this study show that the missing enzyme is the methyltransferase RlmN responsible for introducing the m2A modification at position 2503 of the 23S rRNA, thus demonstrating that RlmN is a dual-specificity enzyme. The authors go on to use a tRNA chimera that should also be useful for the study of other tRNA modifications, to identify the specificity determinants. They also report that strains lacking rlmN have an error-prone phenotype (expected from loss of m2A2503 modification of rRNA) rather than a hyperaccurate phenotype (expected from loss of m2A37 modification of tRNA).},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.033266.112}\n}\n```"
