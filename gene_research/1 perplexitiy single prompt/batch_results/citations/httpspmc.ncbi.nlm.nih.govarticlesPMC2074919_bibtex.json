We retrieved fragments of \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d 16S rRNA and ppk1 genes from one laboratory-scale and several full-scale EBPR systems. Phylogenies reconstructed using 16S rRNA genes and ppk1 were largely congruent, with ppk1 granting higher phylogenetic resolution and clearer tree topology and thus serving as a better genetic marker than 16S rRNA for revealing population structure within the \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d lineage. Sequences from at least five clades of \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d were recovered by ppk1-targeted PCR, and subsequently, specific primer sets were designed to target the ppk1 gene for each clade. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays using \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d-specific 16S rRNA and \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d clade-specific ppk1 primers were developed and conducted on three laboratory-scale and nine full-scale EBPR samples and two full-scale non-EBPR samples to determine the abundance of the total \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d lineage and the relative distributions and abundances of the five \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d clades. The qPCR-based estimation of the total \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d fraction as a proportion of the bacterial community as measured using 16S rRNA genes was not significantly different from the estimation measured using ppk1, demonstrating the power of ppk1 as a genetic marker for detection of all currently defined \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d clades. The relative distributions of \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d clades varied among different EBPR systems and also temporally within a system. Our results suggest that the \u201cCandidatus Accumulibacter\u201d lineage is more diverse than previously realized and that different clades within the lineage are ecologically distinct.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01207-07}\n}\n```"
