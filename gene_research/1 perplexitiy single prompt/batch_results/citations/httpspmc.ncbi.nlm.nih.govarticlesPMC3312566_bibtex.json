This loop is universally conserved, plays a key role in ribosomal accuracy, and is a target for streptomycin binding. Here, the authors explore the mechanisms controlling RsmG expression and activity. The data demonstrate for the first time the critical importance of some residues located in the active site of Escherichia coli RsmG for the m7G modification process and suggest a role for them in rRNA binding and catalysis.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.029868.111}\n}\n```"
