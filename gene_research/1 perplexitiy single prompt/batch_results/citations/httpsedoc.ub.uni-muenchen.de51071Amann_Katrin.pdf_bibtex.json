In the recombinant Anabaena strain, the additional groESL operon was expressed from a strong cyanobacterial P psbA1 promoter without hampering the stress-responsive expression of the native groESL operon. The net expression of the two groESL operons promoted better growth, supported the vital activities of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis at ambient conditions, and enhanced the tolerance of the recombinant Anabaena strain to heat and salinity stresses. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, especially strains of Nostoc and Anabaena, are native to tropical agroclimatic conditions, such as those of Indian paddy fields, and contribute to the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) economy of these soils. However, their biofertilizer potential decreases during exposure to high temperature, salinity, and other such stressful environments. A common target for these stresses is cellular proteins, which are denatured and inactivated during stress, resulting in metabolic arrest, cessation of growth, and eventually loss of viability. Molecular chaperones play a major role in the conformational homeostasis of cellular proteins by (i) proper folding of nascent polypeptide chains; (ii) facilitating protein translocation and maturation to functional conformation, including multiprotein complex assembly; (iii) refolding of misfolded proteins; (iv) sequestering damaged proteins to aggregates; and (v) solubilizing protein aggregates for refolding or degradation. Present at basal levels under optimum growth conditions in bacteria, the expression of chaperonins is significantly enhanced during heat shock and other stresses. The most common and abundant cyanobacterial chaperones are Hsp60 proteins, and nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria possess two or more copies of the hsp60 or groEL gene. One occurs as a solitary gene, cpn60, while the other is juxtaposed to its cochaperonin encoding genes groES and constitutes a bicistronic operon groESL. The two hsp60 genes encode a 59-kDa GroEL and a 61-kDa Cpn60 protein in Anabaena. Both the Hsp60 chaperonins are strongly expressed during heat stress, resulting in the superior thermotolerance of Anabaena, compared to the transient expression of the Hsp60 chaperonins in Escherichia coli. GroEL and Cpn60 stably associate with thylakoid membranes in Anabaena strain PCC7120 and in Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803. In Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, photosynthetic inhibitors downregulate, while light and redox perturbation induce cpn60 expression, and a cpn60 mutant exhibits a light-sensitive phenotype, indicating a possible role for Cpn60 in photosynthesis. GroEL, a lipochaperonin, requires a cochaperonin, GroES, for its folding activity and has wider substrate selectivity. In heterotrophic nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the GroEL protein has been implicated in nif gene expression and the assembly, stability, and activity of the nitrogenase proteins. Earlier work from our laboratory demonstrated that the Hsp60 family chaperonins are commonly induced general-stress proteins in response to heat, salinity, and osmotic stresses in Anabaena strains. Our recent work elucidated a major role of the cpn60 gene in the protection from photosynthesis and the nitrate reductase activity of N-supplemented Anabaena cultures. In this study, we integrated and constitutively overexpressed an extra copy of the groESL operon in Anabaena to evaluate the importance and contribution of GroEL chaperonin to the physiology of Anabaena during optimal and stressful conditions. Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 was photoautotrophically grown in combined nitrogen-free (BG11 \u2212 ) or 17 mM NaNO3-supplemented (BG11 + ) BG11 medium at pH 7.2 under continuous illumination and aeration at 25\u00b0C \u00b1 2\u00b0C. Escherichia coli DH5\u03b1 cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37\u00b0C at 150 rpm. For E. coli DH5\u03b1, kanamycin and carbenicillin were used at final concentrations of 50 \u03bcg ml \u22121 and 100 \u03bcg ml \u22121, respectively. Recombinant Anabaena clones were selected on BG11 + agar plates supplemented with 25 \u03bcg ml \u22121 neomycin or in BG11 \u2212 liquid medium containing 12.5 \u03bcg ml \u22121 neomycin. The growth of cyanobacterial cultures was estimated either by measuring the chlorophyll a content or the turbidity. Photosynthesis was measured as light-dependent oxygen evolution at 25 \u00b1 2\u00b0C by a Clark electrode. Nitrogenase activity was estimated by acetylene reduction assays. Protein denaturation and aggregation were measured in clarified cell extracts containing cytosolic proteins treated with 100 \u03bcM 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS). The complete bicistronic groESL operon (2.040 kb) was PCR amplified from PCC7120 genomic DNA using specific primers and the amplicon cloned into the NdeI-BamHI restriction sites of plasmid vector pFPN, which allows integration at a defined innocuous site in the PCC7120 genome and expression from a strong cyanobacterial P psbA1 promoter. The resulting construct, designated pFPNgro, was electroporated into PCC7120 using an exponential-decay wave form electroporator. The electroporation was carried out at 6 kV cm \u22121 for 5 ms, employing an external autoclavable electrode with a 2-mm gap. The electroporation buffer contained high concentrations of salt. The electrotransformants, selected on BG11 + agar plates supplemented with 25 \u03bcg ml \u22121 neomycin by repeated subculturing for at least 25 weeks to achieve complete segregation, were designated AnFPNgro. This study evaluated the possible benefits of groESL overexpression for the general stress tolerance of PCC7120. The recombinant AnFPNgro strain harbored two groESL operons, one native stress-inducible groESL and a second groESL operon integrated at a defined innocuous site and placed downstream of a constitutive P psbA1 promoter. The recombinant AnFPNgro strain showed an 8- to 10-fold higher constitutive expression of GroEL under ambient conditions than PCC7120, while its inherent stress-induced GroEL expression was not impaired and resulted in 30- and 48-fold more GroEL under salt and heat stress, respectively. The AnFPNgro cells exhibited better growth, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation than PCC7120, suggesting a possible limitation on the availability of GroEL under ambient conditions. The protection of photosynthetic pigments and oxygen photoevolution during salinity stress were particularly impressive. Nearly 2- to 2.5-fold higher GroEL levels in AnFPNgro under heat or salt stress, compared to those of PCC7120, lowered the stress-triggered protein aggregation and had beneficial consequences for photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in the recombinant strain. An overall improvement in the aforesaid vital metabolic activities eventually resulted in the superior tolerance of recombinant AnFPNgro to heat and salt stresses.}\n}\n```"
