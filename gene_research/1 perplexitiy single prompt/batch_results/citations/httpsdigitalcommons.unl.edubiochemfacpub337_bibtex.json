PsaC functions as a membrane-bound oxidoreductase, accepting electrons from the F x iron-sulfur cluster located on the PsaA/PsaB heterodimer and donating them to the soluble electron transfer proteins Fd and flavodoxin (reviewed in Bryant, 1992). The objective of our work is to clarify the role of PsaC in linear and cyclic electron transfer. The experimental organism is Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301, a unicellular, freshwater cyanobacterium that is used extensively for physiological, biochemical, and spectroscopic studies of photosynthesis. The PSI complex of Synechococcus sp. PCC 6301 is widely used in structural and functional studies of the F A and F B iron-sulfur clusters (Parrett et al., 1990).},\n    url = {https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/biochemfacpub/337/}\n}"
