In bacteria, the preference of the central ribonucleases RNase E, RNase J and RNase Y for 5\u2032-monophosphorylated RNAs is considered important for RNA degradation. For RNase E, the underlying mechanism is termed 5\u2032 sensing, contrasting to the alternative \u2018direct entry\u2019 mode, which is independent of monophosphorylated 5\u2032 ends. Cyanobacteria, such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis), encode RNase E and RNase J homologues. Here, we constructed a Synechocystis strain lacking the 5\u2032 sensing function of RNase E and mapped on a transcriptome-wide level 283 5\u2032-sensing-dependent cleavage sites. These included so far unknown targets such as mRNAs encoding proteins related to energy metabolism and carbon fixation. The 5\u2032 sensing function of cyanobacterial RNase E is important for the maturation of rRNA and several tRNAs, including tRNAGluUUC. This tRNA activates glutamate for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plant chloroplasts and in most prokaryotes. Furthermore, we found that increased RNase activities lead to a higher copy number of the major Synechocystis plasmids pSYSA and pSYSM. These results provide a first step towards understanding the importance of the different target mechanisms of RNase E outside Escherichia coli.},\n    doi = {10.1080/15476286.2024.2328438},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2024.2328438},\n}"
