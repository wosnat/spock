There is an alarming situation to find new therapeutic strategies or candidate drugs to tackle ongoing multi-drug resistance development. The marine environment is one of the prime natural ecosystems on Earth, the majority of which is still unexplored, especially when it comes to the microbes. A wide variety of bioactive compounds have been obtained from a varied range of marine organisms; however, marine bacteria-produced bacteriocins are still undermined. Owing to the distinct environmental stresses that marine bacterial communities encounter, their bioactive compounds frequently undergo distinct adaptations that confer on them a variety of shapes and functions, setting them apart from their terrestrial counterparts. Bacterially produced ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPPs), known as bacteriocins, are one of the special interests to be considered as an alternative to conventional antibiotics because of their variety in structure and diverse potential biological activities. Additionally, the gut microbiome of marine creatures are a largely unexplored source of new bacteriocins with promising activities. There is a huge possibility of novel bacteriocins from marine bacterial communities that might come out as efficient candidates to fight against antibiotic resistance, especially in light of the growing pressure from antibiotic-resistant diseases and industrial desire for innovative treatments. The present review summarizes known and fully characterized marine bacteriocins, their evolutionary aspects, challenges, and the huge possibilities of unexplored novel bacteriocins from marine bacterial communities present in diverse marine ecosystems.}\n}\n```"
