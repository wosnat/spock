In cyanobacteria, an ancient phylum of significant ecological and biotechnological relevance, protein phosphorylation emerges as a central regulatory axis mediating adaptive responses that are essential for survival and growth. This exhaustive review thoroughly explores the complex terrain of protein phosphorylation in cyanobacterial adaptation and metabolism, illustrating its diverse forms and functional implications. Commencing with an overview of cyanobacterial physiology and the historical trajectory of protein phosphorylation research in prokaryotes, this review navigates through the complex mechanisms of two-component sensory systems and their interplay with protein phosphorylation. Furthermore, it investigates the different feeding modes of cyanobacteria and highlights the complex interplay between photoautotrophy, environmental variables, and susceptibility to photo-inhibition. The significant elucidation of the regulatory role of protein phosphorylation in coordinating light harvesting with the acquisition of inorganic nutrients underscores its fundamental importance in the cyanobacterial physiology. This review highlights its novelty by synthesizing existing knowledge and proposing future research trajectories, thereby contributing to the deeper elucidation of cyanobacterial adaptation and metabolic regulation through protein phosphorylation.}\n}\n```"
