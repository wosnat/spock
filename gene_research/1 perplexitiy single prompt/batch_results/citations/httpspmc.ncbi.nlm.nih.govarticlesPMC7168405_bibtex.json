The intein\u2010encoded protein region is removed by an autocatalytic protein\u2010splicing reaction that ligates the host protein flanks with a peptide bond. This reaction can also occur in trans with the intein and host protein split in two. After translation of the two genes, the two intein parts ligate their flanking protein parts to each other, producing the mature protein. Naturally split inteins are only known in the DNA polymerase III alpha subunit (polC or dnaE gene) of a few cyanobacteria. Analysing the phylogenetic distribution and probable genetic propagation mode of these split inteins, we conclude that they are genetically fixed in several large cyanobacterial lineages. To test our hypothesis, we sequenced parts of the dnaE genes from five diverse cyanobacteria and found all species to have the same type of split intein. Our results suggest the occurrence of a genetic rearrangement in the ancestor of a large division of cyanobacteria. This event fixed the dnaE gene in a unique two\u2010genes one\u2010protein configuration in the progenitor of many cyanobacteria. Our hypothesis, findings and the cloning procedure that we established allow the identification and acquisition of many naturally split inteins. Having a large and diverse repertoire of these unique inteins will enable studies of their distinct activity and enhance their use in biotechnology.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2958.2003.03825.x}\n}\n```"
