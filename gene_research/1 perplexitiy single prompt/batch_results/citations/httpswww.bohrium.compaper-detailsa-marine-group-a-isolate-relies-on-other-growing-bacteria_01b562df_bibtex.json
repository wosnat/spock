Here we report the isolation of a bacterial strain, IA91, belonging to the candidate phylum Marine Group A (SAR406 or 'Candidatus Marinimicrobia') that is unable to synthesize the central cell wall compound peptidoglycan itself. Using cultivation experiments and microscopy, we show that IA91 growth and cell shape depend on other bacteria, deriving peptidoglycan, energy and carbon from exogenous muropeptide cell wall fragments released from growing bacteria. Reliance on exogenous muropeptides is traceable to the phylum's ancestor, with evidence of vertical inheritance across several classes. This dependency may be widespread across bacteria (16 phyla) based on the absence of key peptidoglycan synthesis genes. These results suggest that uptake of exogenous cell wall components could be a relevant and potentially common survival strategy in energy-limited habitats like the deep biosphere.},\n    url = {https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-024-01717-7}\n}\n```"
