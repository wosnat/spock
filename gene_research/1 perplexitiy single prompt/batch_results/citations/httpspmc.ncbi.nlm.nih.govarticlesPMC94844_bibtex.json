The five carbons of the basic isoprenoid unit are assembled by joining pyruvate and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The reaction is catalyzed by the thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase. In Rhodobacter capsulatus, two open reading frames (ORFs) carry the genes that encode 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase. ORF 2816 is located in the photosynthesis-related gene cluster, along with most of the genes required for synthesis of the photosynthetic machinery of the bacterium, whereas ORF 2895 is located elsewhere in the genome. The proteins encoded by ORF 2816 and ORF 2895, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase A and B, containing a His 6 tag, were synthesized in Escherichia coli and purified to greater than 95% homogeneity in two steps. 1-Deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase A appears to be a homodimer with 68 kDa subunits. A new assay was developed, and the following steady-state kinetic constants were determined for 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase A and B: K m pyruvate = 0.61 and 3.0 mM, K m d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate = 150 and 120 \u03bcM, and V max = 1.9 and 1.4 \u03bcmol/min/mg in 200 mM sodium citrate (pH 7.4). The ORF encoding 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase B complemented the disrupted essential dxs gene in E. coli strain FH11. Isoprenoid compounds form a large, ubiquitous class of natural products consisting of over 30,000 individual members. They have a wide variety of cellular functions\u2014such as components of cell membranes (sterols), electron transport (ubiquinones), signal transduction (prenylated proteins), photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls), and cell wall biosynthesis (dolichols)\u2014essential for viability.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.183.1.1-11.2001}\n}\n```"
