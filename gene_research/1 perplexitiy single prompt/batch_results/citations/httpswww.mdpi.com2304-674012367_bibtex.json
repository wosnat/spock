These chemical alterations include, among others, methylation, sulfuration, hydroxylation, and acetylation. These changes are necessary for the proper codon recognition and stability of tRNA. In Escherichia coli, sulfur modification at the wobble uridine (34) of lysine, glutamic acid, and glutamine is essential for codon and anticodon binding and prevents frameshifting during translation. Two important proteins that are involved in this thiolation modification are the L-cysteine desulfurase IscS, the initial sulfur donor, and tRNA-specific 2-thiouridylase MnmA, which adenylates and finally transfers the sulfur from IscS to the tRNA. tRNA-specific 2-thiouridylases are iron\u2013sulfur clusters (Fe-S), either dependent or independent depending on the organism. Here, we dissect the controversy of whether the E. coli MnmA protein is an Fe-S cluster-dependent or independent protein. We show that when Fe-S clusters are bound to MnmA, tRNA thiolation is inhibited, making MnmA an Fe-S cluster-independent protein. We further show that 2-thiouridylase only binds to tRNA from its own organism.}\n}\n```"
