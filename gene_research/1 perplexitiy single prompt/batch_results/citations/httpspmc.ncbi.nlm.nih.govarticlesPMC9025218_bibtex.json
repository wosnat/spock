These organisms also developed light-dependent redox regulation through the Trx system, formed by thioredoxins (Trxs) and thioredoxin reductases (TRs). Trxs are thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases that serve as reducing substrates for target enzymes involved in numerous processes such as photosynthetic CO2 fixation and stress responses. We focus on the evolutionary diversity of Trx systems in cyanobacteria and discuss their phylogenetic relationships. The study shows that most cyanobacteria contain at least one copy of each identified Trx, and TrxA is the only one present in all genomes analyzed. Ferredoxin thioredoxin reductase (FTR) is present in all groups except Gloeobacter and Prochlorococcus, where there is a ferredoxin flavin-thioredoxin reductase (FFTR). Our data suggest that both TRs may have coexisted in ancestral cyanobacteria together with other evolutionarily related proteins such as NTRC or DDOR, probably used against oxidative stress. Phylogenetic studies indicate that they have different evolutionary histories. As cyanobacteria diversified to occupy new habitats, some of these proteins were gradually lost in some groups. Finally, we also review the physiological relevance of redox regulation in cyanobacteria through the study of target enzymes.}\n}\n```"
