The permuted gene structure found in a group of cyanobacteria is shown to produce a two-piece mature tmRNA, as had been observed previously for the independently permuted gene of \u03b1-proteobacteria. The pieces have been mapped onto the gene sequence and aligned for the permuted cyanobacterial tmRNA sequences, including four novel sequences. Structural probing and base pair co-variations support a secondary structure model in which two pairings in the tRNA-like domain hold the two pieces together, and the coding piece bearing the tag reading frame additionally contains a single transient pseudoknot and three other stem\u2013loops. This represents a dramatic reduction in pseudoknot number from the five present in one-piece cyanobacterial tmRNA.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/30.9.2018},\n}\n```"
