Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP) is a relatively newly discovered second messenger implicated in cell wall homeostasis in many pathogenic bacteria. C-di-AMP is synthesized from ATP by diadenylyl cyclases (DAC) and degraded by specific c-di-AMP phosphodiesterases (PDE). C-di-AMP DACs and PDEs are present in all sequenced cyanobacteria, suggesting roles for c-di-AMP in the physiology and/or development of these organisms. Despite conservation of these genes across numerous cyanobacteria, the functional roles of c-di-AMP in cyanobacteria have not been well-investigated. In a unique feature of cyanobacteria, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the broadly conserved DAC, related to CdaA/DacA, is always co-associated in an operon with genes critical for controlling cell wall synthesis. To investigate phenotypes regulated by c-di-AMP in cyanobacteria, we overexpressed native DAC (sll0505) and c-di-AMP PDE (slr0104) genes in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) to increase and decrease intracellular c-di-AMP levels, respectively. DAC- and PDE-overexpression strains, showed abnormal aggregation phenotypes, suggesting functional roles for regulating c-di-AMP homeostasis in vivo. As c-di-AMP may be implicated in osmotic responses in cyanobacteria, we tested whether sorbitol and NaCl stresses impacted expression of sll0505 and slr0104 or intracellular c-di-AMP levels in Synechocystis. Additionally, to determine the range of cyanobacteria in which c-di-AMP may function, we assessed c-di-AMP levels in two unicellular cyanobacteria, i.e., Synechocystis and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, and two filamentous cyanobacteria, i.e., Fremyella diplosiphon and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. C-di-AMP levels responded differently to abiotic stress signals in distinct cyanobacteria strains, whereas salt stress uniformly impacted another second messenger cyclic di-GMP in cyanobacteria. Together, these results suggest regulation of c-di-AMP homeostasis in cyanobacteria and implicate a role for the second messenger in maintaining cellular fitness in response to abiotic stress.}\n}\n```"
