The sensing of P by cyanobacteria in the environment is predominantly regulated by two-component signal transduction systems in which the phosphate (Pho) regulon plays a crucial role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis. It responds rapidly and connects to metabolic processes through cross-talk mechanisms. However, the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of the cyanobacterial response to different P sources remain unclear. This review article aims to integrate the physiological and molecular information on the regulatory mechanisms of the cyanobacterial response to different P sources in terms of hydrolysis, transport, and inorganic P (DIP) utilization strategies. Topics covered include enzymatic utilization of DOP (C-O-P, C-P), phosphate transport systems, and exploring the potential P metabolic pathways that might occur in cyanobacteria. This is of great significance for mitigating eutrophication and maintaining the sustainable development of aquatic systems.}\n}\n```"
