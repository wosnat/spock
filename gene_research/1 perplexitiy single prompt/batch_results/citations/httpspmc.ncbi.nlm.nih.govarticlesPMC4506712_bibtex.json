The clock of cyanobacteria is driven by a three-protein oscillator comprised of KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together generate a circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation. We show that KaiB flips between two distinct three-dimensional folds, and its rare transition to an active state provides a time delay that is required to match the timing of the oscillator to that of earth\u2019s rotation. Once KaiB switches folds, it binds phosphorylated KaiC and captures KaiA, initiating a phase transition of the circadian cycle, and regulates components of the clock-output pathway, providing the link that joins the timekeeping and signaling functions of the oscillator.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1260031}\n}\n```"
