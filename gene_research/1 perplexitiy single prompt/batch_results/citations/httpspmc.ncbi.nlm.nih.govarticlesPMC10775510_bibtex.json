Understanding the molecular composition of the TF genes in thermophilic cyanobacteria will facilitate further studies regarding verifying their exact biochemical functions and genetic engineering. However, limited information is available on the TFs of thermophilic cyanobacteria. Herein, a thorough investigation and comparative analysis were performed to gain insights into the molecular composition of the TFs in 22 thermophilic cyanobacteria. The results suggested a fascinating diversity of the TFs among these thermophiles. The abundance and type of TF genes were diversified in these genomes. The identified TFs are speculated to play various roles in biological regulations. Further comparative and evolutionary genomic analyses revealed that HGT may be associated with the genomic plasticity of TF genes in Thermostichus and Thermosynechococcus strains. Comparative analyses also indicated different pattern of TF composition between thermophiles and corresponding mesophilic reference cyanobacteria. Moreover, the identified unique TFs of thermophiles are putatively involved in various biological regulations, mainly as responses to ambient changes, may facilitating the thermophiles to survive in hot springs. The findings herein shed light on the TFs of thermophilic cyanobacteria and fundamental knowledge for further research regarding thermophilic cyanobacteria with a broad potential for transcription regulations in responses to environmental fluctuations.}\n}\n```"
