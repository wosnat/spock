An intense effort has been dedicated to assessing the therapeutic efficacy of the marine natural products and metabolites obtained from marine bacteria in cancer therapy. Fast and reliable analytical bacterial genome sequencing provides specialized bioinformatic tools to identify potential gene clusters in bacteria for obtaining secondary metabolites. This study aimed to analyze the genome sequences of marine bacteria to recognize bioactive compounds with anti-cancer properties. Marine bacteria with the genomic sequences registered in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) genome database were used in this study. The genome was analyzed for proteins, tRNAs, and rRNAs from GenBank entries by Feature Extract 1.2L Server. The Anti-SMASH webserver was used for the analysis of unique marine bacterial metabolites of the marine bacterial genome, available from the NCBI database. A number of marine bacterial species, including Salinispora arenicola, Salinispora tropica, Crocosphaera watsonii, and Blastopirellula marina encoded metabolites belonging to the polyketide and nonribosomal peptide (NRP) families, showing anti-cancer properties. Among the marine species described, S. tropica and S. arenicola are richer in the genes encoding polyketide and NRP with potential antitumor activities. Marine bacteria are an excellent and exceptional source of anti-cancer compounds. In silico genome analysis of marine bacteria provided an opportunity to evaluate gene clusters for known natural products. Like this chemical engineering approaches for pharmaceutical application are useful in clinical evaluation of cancer treatment.}\n}\n```"
