The S. enterica usg gene is associated with intracellular survival based on ortholog screening and identification. In this study, the \u03bb-Red recombination system was used to construct gene deletion strains and to investigate whether the identified operon was related to intracellular survival. The pdxB - usg - truA - dedA operon enhanced the intracellular survival of S. enterica by resisting the oxidative environment and the usg and truA gene expression was induced by H2O2. Moreover, the genes in this operon (except for dedA) contributed to virulence in mice. These findings indicate that the pdxB - usg - truA - dedA operon functions in resistance to oxidative environments during intracellular survival and is required for in vivo S. enterica virulence. This study provides insight toward a better understanding of the characteristics of intracellular pathogens and explores the gene modules involved in their intracellular survival.}\n}\n```"
