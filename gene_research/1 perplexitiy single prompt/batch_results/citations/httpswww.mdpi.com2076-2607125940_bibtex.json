These two ATP synthases exhibit similarities in gene organization, amino acid sequences of subunits, structure, and functional mechanisms, suggesting that cyanobacterial ATP synthase is probably the evolutionary precursor to chloroplast ATP synthase. In this review, we explore the precise synthesis and assembly of ATP synthase subunits to address the uneven stoichiometry within the complex during transcription, translation, and assembly processes. We also compare the regulatory strategies governing ATP synthase activity to meet varying energy demands in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts amid fluctuating natural environments. Furthermore, we delve into the role of ATP synthase in stress tolerance and photosynthetic carbon fixation efficiency in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms (OPsOs), along with the current researches on modifying ATP synthase to enhance carbon fixation efficiency under stress conditions. This review aims to offer theoretical insights and serve as a reference for understanding the functional mechanisms of ATP synthase, sparking innovative ideas for enhancing photosynthetic carbon fixation efficiency by utilizing ATP synthase as an effective module in OPsOs.}\n}\n```"
