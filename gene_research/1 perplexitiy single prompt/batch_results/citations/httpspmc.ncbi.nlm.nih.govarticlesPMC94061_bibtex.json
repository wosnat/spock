This fab gene cluster is delimited by the plsX (encoding a poorly understood enzyme of phospholipid metabolism) and pabC (encoding 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase) genes; the fabF and pabC genes seem to be translationally coupled. The fabH gene (encoding \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III), which in most gram-negative bacteria is located between plsX and fabD, is absent from this gene cluster. A chromosomal temperature-sensitive fabD mutant was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis that resulted in a W258Q change. A chromosomal fabF insertion mutant was generated, and the resulting mutant strain contained substantially reduced levels of cis-vaccenic acid. Multiple attempts aimed at disruption of the chromosomal fabG gene were unsuccessful. We purified FabD as a hexahistidine fusion protein (H6-FabD) and ACP in its native form via an ACP-intein-chitin binding domain fusion protein, using a novel expression and purification scheme that should be applicable to ACP from other bacteria. Matrix-assisted laser desorption\u2013ionization spectroscopy, native polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and amino-terminal sequencing revealed that (i) most of the purified ACP was properly modified with its 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine functional group, (ii) it was not acylated, and (iii) the amino-terminal methionine was removed. In an in vitro system, purified ACP functioned as acyl acceptor and H6-FabD exhibited malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase activity. Fatty acid biosynthesis in eukaryotes is catalyzed by a multienzyme complex encoded by a single gene and known as the type I system. In contrast, eubacteria contain a type II or dissociated Fab (fatty acid biosynthesis) system, where the reactions are carried out by proteins encoded by multiple genes. Bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis necessitates a three-carbon precursor, malonyl-coenzyme A (CoA), which is derived from acetyl-CoA by the action of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The malonyl-CoA is transferred to the acyl carrier protein (ACP) by malonyl-CoA:ACP acyltransferase (FabD). Fatty acid elongation involves four reactions: (i) a condensation reaction catalyzed by one of three \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP synthases, FabB, FabF, or FabH; (ii) a reduction involving a NADPH-dependent \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG); (iii) a dehydration reaction catalyzed by either FabA or FabZ, both of which are \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratases with broad, overlapping chain length specificities; and (iv) a second reduction reaction catalyzed by NADH-dependent enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI). In Escherichia coli and other bacteria, the genes acpP, fabD, fabF, fabG, and fabH, encoding ACP, FabD, FabF, FabG, and FabH, respectively, are contained in a fab gene cluster. In Bacillus subtilis, fabH is not part of the major fab gene cluster. Besides the role of ACP in phospholipid and rhamnolipid synthesis, ACPs play central roles in a broad range of other biosynthetic pathways that depend on acyl transfer reactions, including polyketide, nonribosomal peptide, and depsipeptide biosynthesis, as well as in the transacylation of oligosaccharides and proteins. More recently, acyl-ACPs derived from the Fab pathway have been proposed to be the acyl donors for synthesis of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs). The AHLs (or autoinducers) have received considerable attention in recent years since they are required for a regulatory phenomenon termed quorum sensing. Characterization of the two known AHL-producing systems of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhl and las, has shown that the respective autoinducers, N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) and N-(3-oxo)-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL), are required for expression of a multitude of virulence factors and secondary metabolites. We recently began characterization of the unique aspects of the P. aeruginosa Fab system, and in this report we describe the characterization of the P. aeruginosa fabD-fabG-acpP-fabF gene cluster, as well as the purification and characterization of FabD and ACP.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.181.17.5498-5504.1999}\n}\n```"
