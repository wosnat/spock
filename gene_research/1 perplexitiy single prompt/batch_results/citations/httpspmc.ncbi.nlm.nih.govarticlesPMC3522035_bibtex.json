Studies have found that the internal clock consists of an array of genes and the protein products they encode, which regulate various physiological processes throughout the body. Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142 is an organism that has both photosynthetic (producing oxygen) and nitrogen fixing ability. It has developed a temporal regulation in which N2 fixation and photosynthesis occur at different times throughout a diurnal cycle with very high levels of CO2 fixation during the light and high levels of N2 fixation in the dark. The mechanisms underlying the circadian rhythm and the signature genes elucidating this mechanism are addressed in this research.}\n}\n```"
