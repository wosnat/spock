Biogenesis of this complex plastid poses a unique challenge requiring evolution of new cellular machinery. We previously conducted a mutagenesis screen for essential apicoplast biogenesis genes to discover organellar pathways with evolutionary and biomedical significance. Here we validate and characterize a gene candidate from our screen, Pf3D7_0913500. Using a conditional knockdown strain, we show that Pf3D7_0913500 depletion causes growth inhibition that is rescued by the sole essential product of the apicoplast, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), and results in apicoplast loss. Because Pf3D7_0913500 had no previous functional annotation, we name it a picoplast-minus IPP-rescued 4 (AMR4). AMR4 has an annotated CaaX protease and bacteriocin processing (CPBP) domain, which in eukaryotes typically indicates a role in CaaX postprenylation processing. Indeed, AMR4 is the only putative CaaX-like protease in Plasmodium parasites which are known to require protein prenylation, and we confirm that the conserved catalytic residue of AMR4 (E352) is required for its apicoplast function. However, we unexpectedly find that AMR4 does not act in a CaaX postprenylation processing pathway in Plasmodium falciparum. Instead, we find that AMR4 is imported into the apicoplast and is derived from a cyanobacterial CPBP gene which was retained through both primary and secondary endosymbiosis. Our findings suggest that AMR4 is not a true CaaX protease, but instead it performs a conserved, uncharacterized chloroplast function that has been retained for complex plastid biogenesis.},\n    pmcid = {PMC7542359},\n    pmid = {33024034}\n}\n```"
