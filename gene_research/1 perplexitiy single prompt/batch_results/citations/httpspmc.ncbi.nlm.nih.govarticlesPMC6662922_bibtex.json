To engineer these organisms and manipulate their metabolic pathways, the biotechnology community has had to develop genetic tools to control gene expression. Many native cyanobacterial promoters and related sequence elements have been used to regulate genes of interest and heterologous tools that use non-native small molecules to induce gene expression have been demonstrated. Overall, IPTG-based induction systems seem to be very leaky and have low fold induction ratios in cyanobacteria. A variety of other induction systems have been optimized to enable tighter control of gene expression. There are substantial differences in performance of many of these promoters and induction systems in cyanobacteria compared to E. coli, and we hypothesize that these differences are due to fundamental differences in physiology between organisms. This review is not intended to summarize all known products made in cyanobacteria and nor the performance (titer, rate, yield) of individual strains, but instead will focus on the genetic tools used to control gene expression the inherent aspects of cellular physiology that influence and control gene expression in cyanobacteria.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-0854-3_12}\n}\n```"
