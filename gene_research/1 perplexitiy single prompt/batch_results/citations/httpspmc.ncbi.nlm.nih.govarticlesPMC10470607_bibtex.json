Here, we applied, and generated new parts for, a modular plasmid toolkit to study marine bacteria in the context of symbioses and host-microbe interactions. To demonstrate the utility of this plasmid system, we genetically manipulated the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea, which stimulates the metamorphosis of the model tubeworm, Hydroides elegans. Using these tools, we quantified constitutive and native promoter expression, developed reporter strains that enable the imaging of host-bacteria interactions, and used CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to knock down a secondary metabolite and a host-associated gene. We demonstrate the broader utility of this modular system for testing the genetic tractability of marine bacteria that are known to be associated with diverse host-microbe symbioses. These efforts resulted in the successful conjugation of 12 marine strains from the Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria classes. Altogether, the present study demonstrates how synthetic biology strategies enable the investigation of marine microbes and marine host-microbe symbioses with potential implications for environmental restoration and biotechnology.}\n}\n```"
