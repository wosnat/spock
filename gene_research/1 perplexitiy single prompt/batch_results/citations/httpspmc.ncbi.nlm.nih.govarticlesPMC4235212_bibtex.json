Almost all bacteria use the transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA)-based trans-translation pathway to release these \u201cnonstop\u201d ribosomes and maintain protein synthesis capacity. trans-translation is essential in some species, but in others, such as Caulobacter crescentus, trans-translation can be inactivated. To determine why trans-translation is dispensable in C. crescentus, a Tn-seq screen was used to identify genes that specifically alter growth in cells lacking ssrA, the gene encoding tmRNA. One of these genes, CC1214, was essential in \u0394ssrA cells. Purified CC1214 protein could release nonstop ribosomes in vitro. CC1214 is a homolog of the Escherichia coli ArfB protein, and using the CC1214 sequence, ArfB homologs were identified in the majority of bacterial phyla. Most species in which ssrA has been deleted contain an ArfB homolog, suggesting that release of nonstop ribosomes may be essential in most or all bacteria.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01916-14}\n}\n```"
