Recently, a high-resolution X-ray structure of the mature PSII complex has become available. Two PSII polypeptides, D1 and CP43, provide many of the ligands to an inorganic Mn4Ca center that is essential for water oxidation. Because of its unusual redox chemistry, PSII often undergoes degradation followed by stepwise assembly. Psb27, a small luminal polypeptide, functions as an important accessory factor in this elaborate assembly pathway. However, the structural location of Psb27 within PSII assembly intermediates has remained elusive. Here we report that Psb27 binds to CP43 in such assembly intermediates. We treated purified genetically tagged PSII assembly intermediate complexes from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 with chemical cross-linkers to examine intermolecular interactions between Psb27 and various PSII proteins. First, the water-soluble 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) was used to cross-link proteins with complementary charged groups in close association to one another. In the His27\u25b3 ctpA PSII preparation, a 58-kDa cross-linked species containing Psb27 and CP43 was identified. This species was not formed in the HT3\u25b3 ctpA \u25b3 psb27 PSII complex in which Psb27 was absent. Second, the homobifunctional thiol-cleavable cross-linker 3,3\u2032-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) was used to reversibly cross-link Psb27 to CP43 in His27\u25b3 ctpA PSII preparations, which allowed the use of liquid chromatography/tandem MS to map the cross-linking sites as Psb27K63\u2194CP43D321 (trypsin) and CP43K215\u2194Psb27D58 AGGLK63\u2194CP43D321 (chymotrypsin), respectively. Our data suggest that Psb27 acts as an important regulatory protein during PSII assembly through specific interactions with the luminal domain of CP43.},\n    pmid = {22031695},\n    pmcid = {PMC3215006}\n}\n```"
