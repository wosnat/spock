They employ a thiol-based catalytic mechanism to reduce H2O2, alkylhydroperoxide, and peroxinitrite. In plants and cyanobacteria, there exist 2-CysPrx, 1-CysPrx, PrxQ, and type II Prx. Higher plants typically contain at least one plastid 2-CysPrx, one nucleo-cytoplasmic 1-CysPrx, one chloroplast PrxQ, and one each of cytosolic, mitochondrial, and plastidic type II Prx. Cyanobacteria express variable sets of three or more Prxs. The catalytic cycle consists of three steps: (i) peroxidative reduction, (ii) resolving step, and (iii) regeneration using diverse electron donors such as thioredoxins, glutaredoxins, cyclophilins, glutathione, and ascorbic acid. Prx proteins undergo major conformational changes in dependence of their redox state. Thus, they not only modulate cellular reactive oxygen species- and reactive nitrogen species-dependent signaling, but depending on the Prx type they sense the redox state, transmit redox information to binding partners, and function as chaperone. They serve in context of photosynthesis and respiration, but also in metabolism and development of all tissues, for example, in nodules as well as during seed and fruit development. The article surveys the current literature and attempts a mostly comprehensive coverage of present day knowledge and concepts on Prx mechanism, regulation, and function and thus on the whole Prx systems in plants.}\n}\n```"
