Blocking the transportation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a crucial component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is considered a promising strategy for drug discovery. In the transportation process of LPS, two components of the LPS transport (Lpt) complex, LptA and LptC, are responsible for shuttling LPS across the periplasm to the outer membrane, highlighting their potential as targets for antibacterial drug development. In the current study, a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) model of LptA and LptC was constructed, and a molecular screening strategy was employed to search a protein\u2013protein interaction compound library. The screening results indicated that compound 18593 exhibits favorable binding free energy with LptA and LptC. In comparison with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on currently known inhibitors, compound 18593 shows more stable target binding ability at the same level. The current study suggests that compound 18593 may exhibit an inhibitory effect on the LPS transport process, making it a promising hit compound for further research.},\n    issn = {1420-3049},\n    doi = {10.3390/molecules29081827},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29081827}\n}\n```"
