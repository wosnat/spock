Here, a global activator named IutR has been identified through three-dimensional chromosome organization and transcriptome analysis in a model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Inactivation of all three homologous IutR-encoding genes resulted in an impaired tolerance of Synechocystis to Fe deficiency and loss of the responses of Fe uptake\u2013related genes to Fe-deplete conditions. Protein-promoter interaction assays confirmed the direct binding of IutR with the promoters of genes related to Fe uptake, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis further revealed that in addition to Fe uptake, IutR could regulate many other physiological processes involved in intracellular Fe homeostasis. These results proved that IutR is an important transcriptional activator, which is essential for cyanobacteria to induce Fe-deficiency response genes. This study provides in-depth insights into the complicated Fe-deficient signaling network and the molecular mechanism of cyanobacteria adaptation to Fe-deficient environments.},\n    issn = {2375-2548},\n    doi = {10.1126/sciadv.adl6428},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adl6428},\n}\n```"
