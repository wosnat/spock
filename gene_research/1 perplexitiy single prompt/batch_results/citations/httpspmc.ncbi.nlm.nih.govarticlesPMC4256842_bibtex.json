The genomes of Prochlorococcus spp. indicate that they have a simple CCM composed of one or two HCO3\u2212 pumps and a carboxysome, but its functionality has not been examined. Here, we show that the CCM of Prochlorococcus spp. is effective and efficient, transporting only two molecules of HCO3\u2212 per molecule of CO2 fixed. A mechanistic, numerical model with a structure based on the CCM components present in the genome is able to match data on photosynthesis, CO2 efflux, and the intracellular inorganic carbon pool. The model requires the carboxysome shell to be a major barrier to CO2 efflux and shows that excess Rubisco capacity is critical to attaining a high-affinity CCM without CO2 recovery mechanisms or high-affinity HCO3\u2212 transporters. No differences in CCM physiology or gene expression were observed when Prochlorococcus spp. was fully acclimated to high-CO2 (1,000 \u00b5L L\u22121) or low-CO2 (150 \u00b5L L\u22121) conditions. Prochlorococcus spp. CCM components in the Global Ocean Survey metagenomes were very similar to those in the genomes of cultivated strains, indicating that the CCM in environmental populations is similar to that of cultured representatives.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.114.247049}\n}\n```"
