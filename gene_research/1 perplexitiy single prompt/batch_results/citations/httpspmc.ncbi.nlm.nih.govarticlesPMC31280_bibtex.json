Anabaena has nine DNA MTases. Four are associated with Type II restriction enzymes (Ava I, Ava II, Ava III and the newly recognized inactive Ava IV), and five are not. Of the latter, four may be classified as solitary MTases, those whose function lies outside of a restriction/modification system. The group is defined here based on biochemical and genetic characteristics. The four solitary MTases, DmtA/M. Ava VI, DmtB/M. Ava VII, DmtC/M. Ava VIII and DmtD/M. Ava IX, methylate at GATC, GGCC, CGATCG and rCCGGy, respectively. DmtB methylates cytosines at the N4 position, but its sequence is more similar to N6-adenine MTases than to cytosine-specific enzymes, indicating that it may have evolved from the former. The solitary MTases appear to be of ancient origin within cyanobacteria, while the restriction MTases appear to have arrived by recent horizontal transfer as did five now inactive Type I restriction systems. One MTase, M. Ava V, cannot reliably be classified as either a solitary or restriction MTase. It is structurally unusual and along with a few proteins of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin defines a structural class of MTases distinct from all previously described.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/29.7.1491},\n}\n```"
