UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA), which catalyzes the first committed step of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis, is a prime candidate for therapeutic intervention. MurA is the target of the antibiotic fosfomycin, a natural product produced by Streptomyces. Despite possessing a high degree of sequence conservation with MurA enzymes from fosfomycin-susceptible organisms, recent microbiological studies suggest that MurA from Vibrio fischeri (VfiMurA) may confer fosfomycin resistance via a mechanism that is not yet understood. The crystal structure of VfiMurA in a ternary complex with the substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG) and fosfomycin has been solved to a resolution of 1.93 \u00c5. Fosfomycin is known to inhibit MurA by covalently binding to a highly conserved cysteine in the active site of the enzyme. A comparison of the title structure with the structure of fosfomycin-susceptible Haemophilus influenzae MurA revealed strikingly similar conformations of the mobile substrate-binding loop and clear electron density for a fosfomycin\u2013cysteine adduct. These results suggest that VfiMurA is a robust crystallizer and shares high sequence identity with many clinically relevant bacterial pathogens, making it an ideal system for the structure-guided optimization of new antibacterial agents.}\n}\n```"
