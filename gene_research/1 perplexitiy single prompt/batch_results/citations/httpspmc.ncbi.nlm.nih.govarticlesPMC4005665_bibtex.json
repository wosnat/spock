In general, one specific LeuRS, the domains of which are of the same type, exists in a single cell compartment. However, some species, such as the haloalkaliphile Natrialba magadii, encode two cytoplasmic LeuRSs, Nm LeuRS1 and Nm LeuRS2, which are the first examples of naturally occurring chimeric enzymes with different domains of bacterial and archaeal types. Furthermore, N. magadii encodes typical archaeal tRNA Leu s. The tRNA recognition mode, aminoacylation and translational quality control activities of these two LeuRSs are interesting questions to be addressed. Herein, active Nm LeuRS1 and Nm LeuRS2 were successfully purified after gene expression in Escherichia coli. Under the optimized aminoacylation conditions, we discovered that they distinguished cognate Nm tRNA Leu in the archaeal mode, whereas the N-terminal region was of the bacterial type. However, Nm LeuRS1 exhibited much higher aminoacylation and editing activity than Nm LeuRS2, suggesting that Nm LeuRS1 is more likely to generate Leu-tRNA Leu for protein biosynthesis. Moreover, using Nm LeuRS1 as a model, we demonstrated misactivation of several non-cognate amino acids, and accuracy of protein synthesis was maintained mainly via post-transfer editing. This comprehensive study of the Nm LeuRS/tRNA Leu system provides a detailed understanding of the coevolution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and tRNA.}\n}\n```"
