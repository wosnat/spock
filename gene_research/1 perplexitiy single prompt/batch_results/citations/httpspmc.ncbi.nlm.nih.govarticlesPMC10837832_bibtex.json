The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus responsible for 10% global oxygen production is a prominent example. The dominant theory known as \u201cgenome streamlining\u201d posits that they have extremely large effective population sizes (N_e) such that selection for metabolic efficiency acts to drive genome reduction. Because genome reduction largely took place anciently, this theory builds on the assumption that their ancestors\u2019 N_e was similarly large. Constraining N_e for ancient ancestors is challenging because experimental measurements of extinct organisms are impossible and alternatively reconstructing ancestral N_e with phylogenetic models gives large uncertainties. Here, we develop a new strategy that leverages agent-based modeling to simulate the changes in the genome-wide ratio of radical to conservative nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rate (d_R/d_C) in a possible range of N_e in ancestral populations. This proxy shows expected increases with decreases of N_e only when N_e falls to about 10 k \u2212 100 k or lower, magnitudes characteristic of N_e of obligate endosymbiont species where drift drives genome reduction. Our simulations therefore strongly support a scenario where the primary force of Prochlorococcus genome reduction is drift rather than selection.},\n}\n```"
