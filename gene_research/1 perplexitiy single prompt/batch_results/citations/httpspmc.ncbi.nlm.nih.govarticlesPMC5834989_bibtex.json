RNA regulators like riboswitches play significant role in controlling the gene expression in prokaryotes. The taxonomic distribution of riboswitches suggests that they might be one of the oldest mechanisms of gene control system. In this paper, we analyzed the distribution of different riboswitch families in various cyanobacterial genomes. It was observed that only four riboswitch classes were abundant in cyanobacteria, B12-element (Cob)/AdoCbl/AdoCbl-variant riboswitch being the most abundant. The analysis suggests that riboswitch mode of regulation is present in cyanobacterial species irrespective of their habitat types. A large number of unidentified genes regulated by riboswitches listed in this analysis indicate the wide range of targets for these riboswitch families. The analysis revealed a large number of genes regulated by riboswitches which may assist in elaborating the diversity among the cyanobacterial species.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s12298-018-0504-9}\n}\n```"
