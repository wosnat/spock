Here we report the isolation of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene which encodes a global translational regulatory protein, RsmA (regulator of secondary metabolites). Overexpression of rsmA resulted in a substantial reduction in the levels of extracellular products, including protease, elastase, and staphylolytic (LasA protease) activity as well as the PA-IL lectin, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and the phenazine pigment pyocyanin. While inactivation of rsmA in P. aeruginosa had only minor effects on the extracellular enzymes and the PA-IL lectin, the production of HCN and pyocyanin was enhanced during the exponential phase. The influence of RsmA on N-acylhomoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing was determined by assaying the levels of N-(3-oxododecanoyl)homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) and N-butanoylhomoserine lactone (C4-HSL) produced by the rsmA mutant and the rsmA-overexpressing strain. RsmA exerted a negative effect on the synthesis of both 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL, which was confirmed by using lasI and rhlI translational fusions. These data also highlighted the temporal expression control of the lasI gene, which was induced much earlier and to a higher level during the exponential growth phase in an rsmA mutant. To investigate whether RsmA modulates HCN production solely via quorum-sensing control, hcn translational fusions were employed to monitor the regulation of the cyanide biosynthesis genes (hcnABC). RsmA was shown to exert an additional negative effect on cyanogenesis posttranscriptionally by acting on a region surrounding the hcnA ribosome-binding site. This suggests that, in P. aeruginosa, RsmA functions as a pleiotropic posttranscriptional regulator of secondary metabolites directly and also indirectly by modulating the quorum-sensing circuitry. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen responsible for infections in immunocompromised hosts and in the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. Secretion of numerous toxic compounds and degradative enzymes (elastase, LasA protease, phospholipase C, exotoxin A, exoenzyme S, rhamnolipid, hydrogen cyanide [HCN], and pyocyanin) contributes to the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections. Many of these exoproducts are produced during the late exponential phase of growth, when the cell density is high. In P. aeruginosa, cell density-dependent gene expression is coordinated via N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing. P. aeruginosa contains two quorum-sensing systems, termed las and rhl. The las system consists of the transcriptional activator protein LasR, the AHL synthase LasI, and N-(3-oxododecanoyl) homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL). LasR and 3-oxo-C12-HSL (generated via LasI) work in concert to control lasI expression as well as expression of the P. aeruginosa rhl circuitry, which consists of the regulator RhlR, the AHL synthase RhlI, and N-butanoyl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL). The las and rhl quorum-sensing circuitry operates as a hierarchical cascade responsible for regulating the expression of multiple virulence determinants and secondary metabolites, the type II secretion machinery, and stationary-phase genes (via the alternative sigma factor RpoS).},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.183.22.6676-6683.2001}\n}\n```"
