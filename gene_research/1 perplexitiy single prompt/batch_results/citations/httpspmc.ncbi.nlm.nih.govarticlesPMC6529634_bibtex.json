Comparative genomics shows conservation of this operon in many, but not all, cyanobacterial lineages. Phylogenetic analyses of the operon\u2019s aromatic amino acid genes indicate that five of them were recruited into the operon after duplication events of their respective housekeeping cyanobacterial cognates. We combined the fossil record of cyanobacteria and relaxed molecular clock models to obtain multiple estimates of these duplication events, setting a minimum age for the evolutionary advent of scytonemin at 2.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.3 billion years. The same analyses were used to estimate the advent of cyanobacteria as a group (and thus the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis), at 3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.2 billion years before present. Post hoc interpretation of 16S rRNA-based Bayesian analyses was consistent with these estimates. Because of physiological constraints on the use of UVA sunscreens in general, and the biochemical constraints of scytonemin in particular, scytonemin\u2019s age must postdate the time when Earth\u2019s atmosphere turned oxic, known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). Indeed, our biological estimate is in agreement with independent geochemical estimates for the GOE. The difference between the estimated ages of oxygenic photosynthesis and the GOE indicates the long span (on the order of a billion years) of the era of \u201coxygen oases,\u201d when oxygen was available locally but not globally.},\n}\n```"
