In spite of the availability of several drugs for treating TB, emergence of drug-resistant strains of the pathogen has made treatment and eradication of TB a challenging task. Hence, there is an imperative need for new intervention strategies to target M. tb. The enzymes of the diaminopimelate pathway, involved in lysine biosynthesis as well as in cell wall biosynthesis, have been considered as important anti-TB drug targets. One such enzyme is dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DapB), catalyzing the reduction of 2,3-dihydrodipicolinic acid to 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-dipicolinic acid by utilizing NADH/NADPH as its cofactor. Here, we have generated an antisense knockdown mutant strain of dapB and demonstrated a crucial role of dapB in the in vitro and intracellular growth of M. tb. Further, in silico virtual screening was performed by employing a library of ~95,000 compounds for the identification of inhibitory molecules against DapB. The molecules with high docking scores were screened against the enzymatic activity of DapB to determine their IC50 values. Further, hit molecules that inhibited DapB were screened against the M. tb growth in broth culture and inside macrophages. The molecules exhibiting M. tb inhibition were also evaluated for their cytotoxicity against various mammalian cell lines. In summary, we have identified a lead molecule, B59, with an IC50 value of 11 \u00b5g/mL and MIC99 value of 20 \u00b5g/mL, which can be further optimized to develop potent inhibitory compounds against M. tb DapB.},\n}\n```"
