Therefore, one would expect this trait to be prevalent among organisms in the nutrient-poor open ocean. Here, we show that this is not the case for Prochlorococcus, a globally abundant and ecologically important marine cyanobacterium. Instead, Prochlorococcus relies on co-occurring heterotrophic bacteria to survive extended phases of nutrient and light starvation. Our results highlight the power of microbial interactions to drive major biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and elsewhere with consequences at the global scale.},\n}\n```"
