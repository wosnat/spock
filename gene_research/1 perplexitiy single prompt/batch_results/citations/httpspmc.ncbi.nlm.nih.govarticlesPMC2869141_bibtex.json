Mutants defective in each of these enzymes in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 were constructed and characterized. Activities of the corresponding enzymes in the selected mutants were virtually undetectable, and their ability to synthesize glycogen was entirely abolished. The maximal activities of photosynthetic O2 evolution and the rates of respiration in the dark were significantly decreased in the mutants compared to those in wild-type cells. Addition of 0.2 M NaCl or 3 mM H2O2 to liquid cultures markedly inhibited the growth of the AGPase and GS mutants, while the same treatment had only marginal effects on the wild type. These results suggest a significant role for storage polysaccharides in tolerance to salt or oxidative stress.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00397-08}\n}\n```"
