In prokaryotes, Se is also required for the synthesis of selenouridine and Se-containing cofactor. A large number of selenoprotein families have been identified in diverse prokaryotic organisms, most of which are thought to be involved in various redox reactions. In the last decade or two, computational prediction of selenoprotein genes and comparative genomics of Se metabolic pathways and selenoproteomes have arisen, providing new insights into the metabolism and function of Se and their evolutionary trends in bacteria and archaea. This review aims to offer an overview of recent advances in bioinformatics analysis of Se utilization in prokaryotes. We describe current computational strategies for the identification of selenoprotein genes and generate the most comprehensive list of prokaryotic selenoproteins reported to date. Furthermore, we highlight the latest research progress in comparative genomics and metagenomics of Se utilization in prokaryotes, which demonstrates the divergent and dynamic evolutionary patterns of different Se metabolic pathways, selenoprotein families, and selenoproteomes in sequenced organisms and environmental samples. Overall, bioinformatics analyses of Se utilization, function, and evolution may contribute to a systematic understanding of how this micronutrient is used in nature.}\n}\n```"
