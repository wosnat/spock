We also studied the effect of day length in the presence of glucose on a \u0394 sigB \u0394 sigE mutant. Our results indicated that the absence of SigB or SigD predominately altered gene expression in the dark or in the light, respectively. In the light, approximately 350 genes displayed transcript levels in the \u0394 sigD strain that were different from those of the wild type, with over 200 of these up-regulated in the mutant. In the dark, removal of SigB altered more than 150 genes, and the levels of 136 of these were increased in the mutant compared to those in the wild type. The removal of both SigB and SigE had a major impact on gene expression under mixotrophic growth conditions and resulted in the inability of cells to grow in the presence of glucose with 8-h light and 16-h dark cycles. Our results indicated the importance of group II \u03c3 factors in the global regulation of transcription in this organism and are best explained by using the \u03c3 cycle paradigm with the stochastic release model described previously.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.01036-07},\n}\n```"
