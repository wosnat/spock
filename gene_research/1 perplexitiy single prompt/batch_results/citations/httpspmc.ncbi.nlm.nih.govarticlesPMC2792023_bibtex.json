This enzyme plays essential roles in carbohydrate anabolism and catabolism; it is ubiquitous and highly conserved. The structure of RpiA from Escherichia coli was solved by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing, and refined to 1.5 \u00c5 resolution (R factor 22.4%, R free 23.7%). RpiA exhibits an \u03b1/\u03b2/(\u03b1/\u03b2)/\u03b2/\u03b1 fold, some portions of which are similar to proteins of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. The two subunits of the dimer in the asymmetric unit have different conformations, representing the opening/closing of a cleft. Active site residues were identified in the cleft using sequence conservation, as well as the structure of a complex with the inhibitor arabinose-5-phosphate at 1.25 \u00c5 resolution. A mechanism for acid-base catalysis is proposed.}\n}\n```"
