In the recombinant Anabaena strain, the additional groESL operon was expressed from a strong cyanobacterial P psbA1 promoter without hampering the stress-responsive expression of the native groESL operon. The net expression of the two groESL operons promoted better growth, supported the vital activities of nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis at ambient conditions, and enhanced the tolerance of the recombinant Anabaena strain to heat and salinity stresses.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00838-09},\n}\n```"
