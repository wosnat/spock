A reporter assay showed that under stress conditions the expression of only the dnaK2 gene was induced, suggesting a functional assignment of these homologues. RNA blot hybridization indicated a typical stress response of dnaK2 to heat and high-light stress. Primer extension mapping showed that dnaK2 was transcribed from similar sites under various stress conditions. Although no known sequence motif was detected in the upstream region, a 20-bp sequence element was highly conserved in dnaK2; it was essential not only for the stress induction but also for the basal expression of dnaK2. The ubiquitous upstream localization of this element in each heat shock gene suggests its important role in the cyanobacterial stress response.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.01722-06},\n}\n```"
