In this study, the model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was used as a host for heme synthesis. The heme synthesis pathway and its competitive pathway were modified to obtain an engineered cyanobacteria with high heme production, and the total heme production of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was further enhanced by the optimization of the culture conditions and the enhancement of mixotrophic ability. The co-expression of hemC, hemF, hemH, and the knockout of pcyA, a key gene in the heme catabolic pathway, resulted in a 3.83-fold increase in the heme production of the wild type, while the knockout of chlH, a gene encoding a Mg-chelatase subunit and the key enzyme of the chlorophyll synthesis pathway, resulted in a 7.96-fold increase in the heme production of the wild type; further increased to 2.05 mg/L, its heme production was 10.25-fold that of the wild type under optimized mixotrophic culture conditions. Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 has shown great potential as a cell factory for photosynthetic carbon sequestration for heme production. This study provides novel engineering targets and research directions for constructing microbial cell factories for efficient heme production.}\n}\n```"
