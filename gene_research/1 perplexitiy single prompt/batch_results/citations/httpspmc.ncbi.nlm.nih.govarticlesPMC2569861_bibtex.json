Escherichia coli lipid A is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane by a conserved pathway of nine constitutive enzymes. Following attachment of the core oligosaccharide, lipid A is flipped to the outer surface of the inner membrane by the ABC transporter MsbA, where the O-antigen polymer is attached. Diverse covalent modifications of lipid A may occur during its transit from the outer surface of the inner membrane to the outer membrane. Lipid A modification enzymes are therefore reporters for LPS trafficking within the bacterial cell envelope. Modification systems are highly variable and are often regulated by environmental conditions. Although not required for growth, the modification enzymes modulate the virulence of some Gram-negative pathogens. Heterologous expression of the genes encoding the lipid A modification enzymes in diverse bacteria facilitates the re-engineering of lipid A structures and should enable the development of new vaccines.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.biochem.76.010307.145803}\n}\n```"
