The molecular mechanism by which cyanobacteria adapt to fluctuating phosphorus bioavailability is still unclear. In this study, transcriptomes and gene knockouts were used to investigate the adaptive molecular mechanism of a model coastal cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 during periods of phosphorus starvation and phosphorus recovery (adding sufficient phosphorus after phosphorus starvation). The findings indicated that phosphorus deficiency affected the photosynthesis, ribosome synthesis, and bacterial motility pathways, which recommenced after phosphorus was resupplied. Even more, most of the metabolic pathways of cyanobacteria were enhanced after phosphorus recovery compared to the control which was kept in continuous phosphorus replete conditions. Based on transcriptome, 54 genes potentially related to phosphorus-deficiency adaptation were selected and knocked out individually or in combination. It was found that five mutants showed weak growth phenotype under phosphorus deficiency, indicating the importance of the genes (A0076, A0549-50, A1094, A1320, A1895) in the adaptation of phosphorus deficiency. Three mutants were found to grow better than the wild type under phosphorus deficiency, suggesting that the products of these genes (A0079, A0340, A2284-86) might influence the adaptation to phosphorus deficiency. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that cyanobacteria exposed to highly fluctuating phosphorus concentrations have more sophisticated phosphorus acquisition strategies. These results elucidated that Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 have variable phosphorus response mechanisms to adapt to fluctuating phosphorus concentration, providing a novel perspective of how cyanobacteria may respond to the complex and dynamic environments.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s42995-024-00244-y}\n}\n```"
