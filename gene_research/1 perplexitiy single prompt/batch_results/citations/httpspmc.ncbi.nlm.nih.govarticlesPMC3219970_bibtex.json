Here we perform a comprehensive study of a cyanobacterial transcriptome, that of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, generated by combining three high-resolution data sets: RNA sequencing, tiling expression microarrays, and RNA polymerase chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. We report absolute transcript levels, operon identification, and high-resolution mapping of 5' and 3' ends of transcripts. We identify several interesting features at promoters, within transcripts and in terminators relating to transcription initiation, elongation, and termination. Furthermore, we identify many putative non-coding transcripts. Our results uncover insights that reinforce and extend the current views of bacterial transcription.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2011-12-5-r47}\n}\n```"
