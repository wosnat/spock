It is found in the chloroplasts of plants and cyanobacteria. PSI is composed of at least 14 different subunits, two of which are small hydrophobic proteins of about 7 to 9 Kd and evolutionary related, PsaG (also known as PSI-G) and PsaK (also known as PSI-K), both integral membrane proteins. Cyanobacteria contain only PsaK. While cyanobacterial PSI have phycobilisomes to harvest light, eukaryotic PSI have a membrane-imbedded peripheral antenna. Photosystems I and II occur together in the same sets of organisms. Photosystem I uses light energy to transfer electrons from plastocyanin to ferredoxin, while photosystem II uses light energy to split water and releases molecular oxygen. This entry represents Photosystem I reaction centre subunit PsaK from Cyanobacteria and Rhodophyta (red algae).}\n}"
