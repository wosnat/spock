Deletion of these genes from the genome of A. variabilis strain ATCC 29413 FD yielded strain CSW1, which displayed no chemoheterotrophic growth and an impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity. Photoautotrophic growth of CSW1, however, was unchanged, even with dinitrogen as the nitrogen source. A higher cytochrome c oxidase activity was detected in membrane preparations from dinitrogen-grown CSW1 than from nitrate-grown CSW1, but comparable activities of respiratory oxygen uptake were found in the wild type and in CSW1. Our data indicate that the identified cox gene cluster is essential for fructose-dependent growth in the dark, but not for growth on dinitrogen, and that other terminal respiratory oxidases are expressed in this cyanobacterium. Transcription analysis showed that coxBAC constitutes an operon which is expressed from two transcriptional start points. The use of one of them was stimulated by fructose. Cyanobacteria are prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. However, all cyanobacteria also perform aerobic respiration in the dark. Indeed, cyanobacteria are the only known organisms in which these two most important bioenergetic processes occur in the same compartment. In a natural environment, respiration probably serves as an energy-conserving mechanism during the night, although only a few strains are able to grow heterotrophically in the dark. Some filamentous cyanobacteria can fix dinitrogen in specialized cells termed heterocysts. It has been suggested that in these strains, respiration may have an additional function as a protective mechanism, since nitrogenases, the key enzymes of dinitrogen fixation, are extremely sensitive to oxygen and respiratory activity is considerably higher in heterocysts than in vegetative cells. The respiratory chain in cyanobacteria is intimately linked to photosynthetic electron transport, and the only electron transport components not directly involved in photosynthesis are the terminal respiratory oxidases, which act as the terminal acceptors of the electron transport chains and are therefore the key enzymes of cyanobacterial respiration. In many bacteria, there is more than one terminal respiratory oxidase. The best-characterized terminal oxidases are those that are homologous to the aa 3-type cytochrome c oxidases of mitochondria. Almost all cyanobacteria, even those that are obligate photoautotrophs, contain membrane-bound enzymes capable of the oxidation of cytochrome c. Terminal respiratory oxidases with sequence similarity to the cytochrome bd quinol oxidase, which is found in bacteria, have also been identified in cyanobacteria. We are interested in characterizing the roles of the different branches of the respiratory chain in heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. For the present work, which is aimed at the isolation of cytochrome c oxidase-encoding genes, we chose Anabaena variabilis strain ATCC 29413, one of the few cyanobacteria that is able to form heterocysts, that grows in the dark with both bound nitrogen and N2, and that can be manipulated by molecular biology tools. The variant A. variabilis strain ATCC 29413 FD, which displays a higher efficiency than strain ATCC 29413 in conjugative gene transfer from E. coli, was used for construction of the cytochrome c oxidase mutant.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.183.21.6429-6434.2001},\n}\n```"
