An important strategy for dealing with UV exposure is the biosynthesis of small molecule sunscreens. Among such metabolites, the mycosporine and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) are remarkable for their wide phylogenetic distribution and their unique chemical structures. Here we report the identification of a MAA biosynthetic gene cluster in a cyanobacterium and the discovery of analogous pathways in other sequenced organisms. We have expressed the cluster in a heterologous bacterial host and characterized all four biosynthetic enzymes in vitro. In addition to clarifying the origin of the MAAs, these efforts have revealed two unprecedented enzymatic strategies for imine formation. Mycosporines and MAAs are UV-absorbing small molecules (\u03bb max = 310\u2013360 nm) that are synthesized by cyanobacteria, fungi, and eukaryotic micro- and macroalgae. These metabolites are also ingested and accumulated by numerous marine animals. Discovered and named for mediating light-induced fungal sporulation, mycosporines and MAAs are involved in many other biological processes, including UV photoprotection of organisms and their embryos, osmotic regulation, and defense against oxidative stress. Additionally, their ability to prevent UV-induced skin damage in vivo has led to their commercialization as Helioguard 365\u2122, a formulation containing MAAs shinorine and porphyra-334 that is used in skin care and cosmetic products.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1193637},\n}\n```"
