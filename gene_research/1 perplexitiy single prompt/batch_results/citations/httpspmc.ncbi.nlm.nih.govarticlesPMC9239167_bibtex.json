This form of movement typically requires the deposition of a motility-associated polysaccharide, and several studies indicate that there is complex coregulation of T4P motor activity and polysaccharide production, although a mechanistic understanding of this coregulation is not fully defined. Here, using a combination of genetic, comparative genomic, transcriptomic, protein-protein interaction, and cytological approaches in the model filamentous cyanobacterium N. punctiforme, we provided evidence that a DnaK-type chaperone system coupled the activity of the T4P motors to the production of the motility-associated hormogonium polysaccharide (HPS). The results from these studies indicated that DnaK1 and DnaJ3 along with GrpE comprised a chaperone system that interacted specifically with active T4P motors and was required to produce HPS. Genomic conservation in cyanobacteria and the conservation of the protein-protein interaction network in the model unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 imply that this system is conserved among nearly all motile cyanobacteria and provides a mechanism to coordinate polysaccharide secretion and T4P activity in these organisms.}\n}\n```"
