The predicted product of the gene mutated in the Tn5-692-derived cell division mutant FTN2 has an N-terminal DnaJ domain, as have its cyanobacterial and plant orthologs. Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, when mutated in genes orthologous to ftn2 and ftn6, forms akinete-like cells. Division in cyanobacteria, ancient phototrophic relatives of chloroplasts, may serve as a model for the study of chloroplast division. However, the genetic basis of cell division has been studied much less in cyanobacteria than in heterotrophic bacteria. Conditional fts mutants of Escherichia coli affected in cell division were identified by screening for the formation of nonseptate filaments at a restrictive temperature. FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, forms the basis of a cytoskeletal structure that is used by many bacteria for the mechanical constriction of the cell at the division site. Although present in vegetative cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, FtsZ was not detected in the nondividing, differentiated cells called heterocysts. Cyanobacterial mutants impaired in cell division were identified after chemical mutagenesis. Filamentous mutants were either septate (and thus impaired in cell separation) or serpentine, dividing sporadically to produce long, multinucleoidal cells. The gene mutated by random cassette mutagenesis in a septate mutant of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 was characterized; it may be involved in lipopolysaccharide assembly.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.184.14.3920-3928.2002},\n    pmid = {12039766},\n    pmcid = {PMC135336}\n}\n```"
