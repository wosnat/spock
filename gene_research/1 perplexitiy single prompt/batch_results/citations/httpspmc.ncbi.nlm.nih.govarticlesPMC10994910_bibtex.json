Within bacterial systems, c-di-GMP functions as a pivotal signaling molecule regulating both biofilm formation and dispersion. However, the molecular mechanism of how c-di-GMP modulates biofilm-induced larval metamorphosis remains elusive. Our study reveals that the deletion of a c-di-GMP related gene in Pseudoalteromonas marina led to an increase in the level of bacterial c-di-GMP by knockout technique, and the mutant strain had an enhanced ability to produce more outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). The mutant biofilms had higher induction activity for larval metamorphosis in mussels Mytilus coruscus, and OMVs play a major role in the induction activity. We further explored the function of LPS in OMVs. Extracted LPS induced high larval metamorphosis rate, and LPS content were subject to c-di-GMP and LPS-biosynthesis gene. Thus, we postulate that the impact of c-di-GMP on biofilm-induced metamorphosis is mediated through OMVs and LPS.},\n    pmid = {38575604},\n    pmcid = {PMC10994910}\n}\n```"
