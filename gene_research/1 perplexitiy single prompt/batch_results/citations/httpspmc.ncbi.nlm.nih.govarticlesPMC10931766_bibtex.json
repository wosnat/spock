Most r-proteins have RNA-binding properties and can form protein\u2013protein contacts. Bacterial r-proteins govern the co-transcriptional rRNA folding during ribosome assembly and participate in the formation of the ribosome functional sites, such as the mRNA-binding site, tRNA-binding sites, the peptidyl transferase center, and the protein exit tunnel. In addition to their primary role in a cell as integral components of the protein synthesis machinery, many r-proteins can function beyond the ribosome (the phenomenon known as moonlighting), acting either as individual regulatory proteins or in complexes with various cellular components. The extraribosomal activities of r-proteins have been studied over the decades. In the past decade, our understanding of r-protein functions has advanced significantly due to intensive studies on ribosomes and gene expression mechanisms not only in model bacteria like Escherichia coli or Bacillus subtilis but also in little-explored bacterial species from various phyla. The aim of this review is to update information on the multiple functions of r-proteins in bacteria.}\n}\n```"
