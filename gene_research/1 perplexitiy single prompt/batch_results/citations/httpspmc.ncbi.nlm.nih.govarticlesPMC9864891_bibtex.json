PCC 6803 by inactivating Gdc, the gene-encoding glutamate decarboxylase. The generated \u0394Gdc strain exhibited lower intracellular GABA and higher ALA levels than the wild-type (WT) one. The \u0394Gdc strain\u2019s ALA levels were ~2.8 times higher than those of the WT one when grown with levulinic acid (LA), a competitive inhibitor of porphobilinogen synthase. Abiotic stress conditions including salinity induced by 10 mM NaCl and cold at 4 \u00b0C increased the ALA levels in \u0394Gdc up to ~2.5 and 5 ng g\u22121 cell DW, respectively. The highest ALA production in the \u0394Gdc cyanobacteria grown in BG11 medium was triggered by glucose induction, followed by glutamate supplementation with 60 mM of LA, thereby resulting in ~360 ng g\u22121 cell DW of ALA, that is >300-fold higher ALA accumulation than that observed in \u0394Gdc cyanobacteria grown in normal medium. Increased levels of the gdhA (involved in the interconversion of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to glutamate) and the hemA (a major regulatory target of the ALA biosynthetic pathway) transcripts occurred in \u0394Gdc cyanobacteria grown under modified growth conditions. Our study provides critical insight into the facilitation of ALA production in cyanobacteria.}\n}\n```"
