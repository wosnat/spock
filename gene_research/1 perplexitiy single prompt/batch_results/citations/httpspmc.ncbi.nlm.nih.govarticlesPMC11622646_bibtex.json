Overexpression of the predicted RNA-binding protein Ssr1238 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803 for 24\u2009h led to higher levels of RNase P RNA, tRNAs, and stress-related mRNAs. Co-immunoprecipitation of proteins followed by MS analysis and sequencing of UV crosslinked, co-immunoprecipitated RNA samples identified potential interaction partners of Ssr1238. The most enriched transcript was RNase P RNA, and RnpA, the protein component of RNase P, was among the most highly enriched proteins. A second highly enriched transcript is derived from gene ssl3177, which encodes a central enzyme in cell wall remodelling during cell division. The data also showed a strong connection to the RNA maturation and modification system indicated by co-precipitation of RNA modifying enzymes, riboendonuclease E and enolase. Surprisingly, cyanophycin synthetase and urease were highly enriched as well. In conclusion, Ssr1238 specifically binds to two different transcripts and could be involved in the coordination of RNA maturation, translation, cell division, and aspects of nitrogen metabolism. Our results are consistent with recent findings that the B. subtilis YlxR protein functions as an RNase P modulator (RnpM), extending its proposed role to the phylum cyanobacteria, and suggesting additional functionalities.},\n    issn = {1547-6286},\n    doi = {10.1080/15476286.2024.2429230},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1080/15476286.2024.2429230},\n}\n```"
