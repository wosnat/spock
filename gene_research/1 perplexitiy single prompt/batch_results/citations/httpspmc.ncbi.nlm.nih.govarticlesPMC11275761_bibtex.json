Multiple evolutionary processes have expanded the set of MutS genes in plants relative to other eukaryotes. Here, we investigate the origins and functions of these plant-specific genes. Land plants, green algae, red algae, and glaucophytes share cyanobacterial-like MutS1 and MutS2 genes that presumably were gained via plastid endosymbiotic gene transfer. MutS1 was subsequently lost in some taxa, including seed plants, whereas MutS2 was duplicated in Viridiplantae (i.e., land plants and green algae) with widespread retention of both resulting paralogs. Viridiplantae also have two anciently duplicated copies of the eukaryotic MSH6 gene (i.e., MSH6 and MSH7) and acquired MSH1 via horizontal gene transfer \u2013 potentially from a nucleocytovirus. Despite sharing the same name, \u201cplant MSH1\u201d is not directly related to the gene known as MSH1 in some fungi and animals, which may be an ancestral eukaryotic gene acquired via mitochondrial endosymbiosis and subsequently lost in most eukaryotic lineages. There has been substantial progress in understanding the functions of MSH1 and MSH6/MSH7 in plants, but the roles of the cyanobacterial-like MutS1 and MutS2 genes remain uncharacterized. Known functions of bacterial homologs and predicted protein structures, including fusions to diverse nuclease domains, provide hypotheses about potential molecular mechanisms. Because most plant-specific MutS proteins are targeted to the mitochondria and/or plastids, the expansion of this family appears to have played a large role in shaping plant organelle genetics.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.17.603841}\n}\n```"
