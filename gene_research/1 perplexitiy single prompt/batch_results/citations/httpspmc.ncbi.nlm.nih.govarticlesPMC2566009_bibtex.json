Expression of the three genes took place upon ammonium withdrawal in combined nitrogen-free medium and was NtcA dependent. The genes were transcribed independently, but an amt4-amt1 dicistronic transcript was also produced, and expression was highest for the amt1 gene. A mutant with the whole amt region removed could grow under laboratory conditions using ammonium, nitrate, or dinitrogen as the nitrogen source. Cyanobacteria are a group of organisms characterized by the fact that they perform oxygenic photosynthesis. Filamentous cyanobacteria, such those of the genera Anabaena, Nostoc, and Nodularia, fix nitrogen in specialized cells called heterocysts that are distributed at semiregular distances between the vegetative cells in the filament. In diazotrophic filaments, oxygenic photosynthesis is restricted to vegetative cells, which transfer fixed (reduced) carbon, probably in the form of a sugar like sucrose, to the heterocysts. Heterocysts in turn transfer fixed nitrogen to the vegetative cells. The bacterial Amt proteins are members of a family of permeases widely distributed in living organisms, and their demonstrated function is translocation of ammonia across biological membranes. The question of whether the Amt proteins mediate the translocation of the charged or noncharged species (ammonium or ammonia in the case of the natural substrate) has been amply debated. However, in cyanobacteria, the activity of the Amt proteins results in a net uptake of methylammonium by the cells. In cyanobacteria, expression of nitrogen assimilation genes under nitrogen deprivation requires the transcription factor NtcA.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00613-08}\n}\n```"
