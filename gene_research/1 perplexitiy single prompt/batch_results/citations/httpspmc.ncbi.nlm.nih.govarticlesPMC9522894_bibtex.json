Biological processes offer viable solutions and have gained renewed interest in the recent years. For example, photosynthetic chassis organisms are particularly promising for bioprocesses, as they do not require biomass-derived carbon sources and contribute to atmospheric CO2 fixation, therefore supporting climate change mitigation. Marine cyanobacteria are of particular interest for biotechnology applications, thanks to their rich diversity, their robustness to environmental changes, and their metabolic capabilities with potential for therapeutics and chemicals production without requiring freshwater. The additional cyanobacterial properties, such as efficient photosynthesis, are also highly beneficial for biotechnological processes. Due to their capabilities, research efforts have developed several genetic tools for direct metabolic engineering applications. While progress toward a robust genetic toolkit is continuously achieved, further work is still needed to routinely modify these species and unlock their full potential for industrial applications. In contrast to the understudied marine cyanobacteria, genetic engineering and synthetic biology in freshwater cyanobacteria are currently more advanced with a variety of tools already optimized. This mini-review will explore the opportunities provided by marine cyanobacteria for a greener future. A short discussion will cover the advances and challenges regarding genetic engineering and synthetic biology in marine cyanobacteria, followed by a parallel with freshwater cyanobacteria and their current genetic availability to guide the prospect for marine species.}\n}\n```"
