As a catalyst of the water oxidation reaction within photosystem II, the trace metal is responsible for the evolution of virtually all oxygen in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Mn acts furthermore as an activator or cofactor of numerous enzymes involved in reactive oxygen species scavenging or central and secondary metabolism. While the sufficient supply of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms with Mn is obvious for maintaining photosynthetic activity, the avoidance of cellular Mn overload is also critical. In this review, current knowledge about the Mn homeostasis network in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is presented, including transporters and regulators.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.3390/plants9010018}\n}\n```"
