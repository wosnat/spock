ATP synthase complexes on cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes use proton gradients generated either by photosynthesis or respiration. Atp\u0398 is an ATP synthase regulator in cyanobacteria which is encoded by the gene atpT. Atp\u0398 prevents the hydrolysis of ATP (reverse reaction) that otherwise would occur under unfavorable conditions. In the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Atp\u0398 is expressed maximum in darkness but at very low levels under optimum phototrophic growth conditions or in the presence of glucose. DNA coimmunoprecipitation experiments followed by mass spectrometry identified the binding of the two transcriptional regulators cyAbrB1 and cyAbrB2 to the promoter and the histone-like protein HU to the 5\u2019UTR of atpT. Analyses of nucleotide substitutions in the promoter and GFP reporter assays identified a functionally relevant sequence motif resembling the HLR1 element bound by the RpaB transcription factor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays confirmed interaction of cyAbrB1, cyAbrB2, and RpaB with the promoter DNA. However, overall the effect of transcriptional regulation was comparatively low. In contrast, atpT transcript stabilities differed dramatically, half-lives were 1.6\u2009min in the light, 33\u2009min in the dark and substantial changes were observed if glucose or DCMU were added. These findings show that transcriptional control of atpT involves nucleoid-associated DNA-binding proteins, positive regulation through RpaB, while the major effect on the condition-dependent regulation of atpT expression is mediated by controlling mRNA stability, which is related to the cellular redox and energy status.}\n}\n```"
