They use solar energy to assimilate huge amounts of atmospheric CO2 and produce a large part of the biomass and oxygen that sustain most life forms. Cyanobacteria are therefore increasingly studied for basic research objectives, as well as for the photosynthetic production of chemicals with industrial interests. One potential approach to reduce the cost of future bioproduction processes is to couple them with wastewater treatment, often polluted with urea, which in any case is cheaper than nitrate. As of yet, however, research has mostly focused on a very small number of model cyanobacteria growing on nitrate. Thus, the genetic inventory of the cyanobacterial phylum is still insufficiently employed to meaningfully select the right host for the right purpose. This review reports what is known about urea transport and catabolism in cyanobacteria, and what can be inferred from the comparative analysis of the publicly available genome sequence of the 308 cyanobacteria. We found that most cyanobacteria mostly harbor the genes encoding the urea catabolytic enzymes urease (ureABCDEFG), but not systematically, together with the urea transport (urtABCDE). These findings are consistent with the capacity of the few tested cyanobacteria that grow on urea as the sole nitrogen source. They also indicate that urease is important for the detoxification of internally generated urea (re-cycling its carbon and nitrogen). In contrast, several cyanobacteria have urtABCDE but not ureABCDEFG, suggesting that urtABCDE could operate in the transport of not only urea but also of other nutrients. Only four cyanobacteria appeared to have the genes encoding the urea carboxylase (uc) and allophanate hydrolase (ah) enzymes that sequentially catabolize urea. Three of these cyanobacteria belong to the genera Gloeobacter and Gloeomargarita that have likely diverged early from other cyanobacteria, suggesting that the urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase enzymes appeared in cyanobacteria before urease. These findings indicate that the urea carboxylase and allophanate hydrolase enzymes may have appeared in cyanobacteria before urease. The diverse metabolic pathways of urea transport and decomposition may contribute to differences in their role in the biogeochemistry of urea, as well as in the role that urea plays in the physiology and ecology of cyanobacteria.},\n    pmid = {31551986},\n    pmcid = {PMC6737895}\n}\n```"
