By isolating and classifying several new strains of iridescent Tenacibaculum, we characterized their iridescence under various culture conditions, including pH, agar concentration, salinity, and nutrient availability. The findings suggest that iridescence is influenced by the rigidity of the growth surface and that specific environmental factors may play a role in the biological significance of this phenomenon.}\n}"
