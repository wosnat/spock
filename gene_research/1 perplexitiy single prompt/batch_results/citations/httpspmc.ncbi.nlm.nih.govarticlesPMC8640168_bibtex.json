The phosphatidylglycerol phosphate (PGP) synthase (PgsA), a membrane-embedded enzyme, catalyzes the primary reaction of phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis. Mutations in pgsA frequently correlate with daptomycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and other prevalent infectious pathogens. Here we report the crystal structures of S. aureus PgsA (Sa PgsA) captured at two distinct states of the catalytic process, with lipid substrate (cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol, CDP-DAG) or product (PGP) bound to the active site within a trifurcated amphipathic cavity. The hydrophilic head groups of CDP-DAG and PGP occupy two different pockets in the cavity, inducing local conformational changes. An elongated membrane-exposed surface groove accommodates the fatty acyl chains of CDP-DAG/PGP and opens a lateral portal for lipid entry/release. Remarkably, the daptomycin resistance-related mutations mostly cluster around the active site, causing reduction of enzymatic activity. Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into the dynamic catalytic process of PgsA and structural frameworks beneficial for development of antimicrobial agents targeting PgsA from pathogenic bacteria.}\n}\n```"
