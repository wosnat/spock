The expression of the N\u2010terminally located J\u2010 and G/F\u2010domains is essential and sufficient for the proteins\u2019 fundamental in\u00a0vivo functions, whereas the presence of the full\u2010length protein, containing the C\u2010terminal substrate\u2010binding domains, is crucial under stress conditions.},\n    pmid = {32965069},\n    pmcid = {PMC7609799}\n}\n```"
