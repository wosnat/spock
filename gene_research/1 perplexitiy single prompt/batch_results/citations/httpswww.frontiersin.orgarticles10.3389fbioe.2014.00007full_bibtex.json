Therefore, we believe that cyanobacteria will be extensively used by many plant biologists as additional model system in future analyses. Indeed, for the identification of the entire set of components necessary for photosynthesis only cyanobacteria are suitable as experimental platforms. If this is achieved, the next goal is to transfer this photosynthetic module to other (non-photosynthetic) organisms like E. coli. Moreover, cyanobacteria are attractive as a \u201cgreen\u201d platform for synthetic biology to produce high-value compounds, chemical feedstocks, or even fuels.}\n}\n```"
