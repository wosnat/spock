Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 is unable to synthesize cobalamin de novo, and because of the large size of this tetrapyrrole, an active-transport system must exist for cobalamin uptake. Surprisingly, no cobalamin transport system was identified in the initial annotation of the genome of this organism. With more sophisticated in silico prediction tools, a btuB-cpdA-btuC-btuF operon encoding components putatively required for a B12 uptake (btu) system was identified. The expression of these genes was predicted to be controlled by a cobalamin riboswitch. Global transcriptional profiling by high-throughput RNA sequencing of a cobalamin-independent form of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7002 grown in the absence or presence of cobalamin confirmed regulation of the btu operon by cobalamin. These results suggest the potential importance of nitrogen metabolism in Prochlorococcus high-light I ecotype proliferation in cyclonic eddies. Our findings demonstrate how mesoscale eddies shape microbial community structure in the oligotrophic ocean and how Prochlorococcus communities respond to short-term localized environmental variability.},\n    pmid = {27457716},\n    pmcid = {PMC5019053},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00476-16}\n}\n```"
