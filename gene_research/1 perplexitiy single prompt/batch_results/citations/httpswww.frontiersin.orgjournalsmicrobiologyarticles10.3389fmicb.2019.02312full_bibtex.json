PCR-stop assays revealed the presence of DNA lesions in dried biofilms and an increased accumulation in dried-UV-irradiated biofilms. Different types and/or amounts of DNA lesions were highlighted by a different expression of uvrA, uvrB, uvrC, phrA, and uvsE genes in dried-rewetted biofilms and dried-UV-irradiated-rewetted biofilms, after rehydration for 30 and 60 min. The up-regulation in dried-rewetted biofilms of uvsE gene encoding an UV damage endonuclease, suggested that UV-damage DNA repair contributed to the repair of desiccation-induced damage. While the phrA gene encoding a photolyase was up-regulated only in dried-UV-irradiated-rewetted biofilms. Nucleotide excision repair genes were over-expressed in dried-rewetted biofilms and dried-UV-irradiated-rewetted biofilms, with uvrC gene showing the highest increase in dried-UV-irradiated-rewetted biofilms. Dried biofilms preserved intact mRNAs (at least of the investigated genes) and 16S ribosomal RNA that the persistence of the ribosome machinery and mRNAs might have played a key role in the early phase recovery. Results have implications for the search of extra-terrestrial life by contributing to the definition of habitability of astrobiologically relevant targets such as Mars or planets orbiting around other stars.}\n}\n```"
