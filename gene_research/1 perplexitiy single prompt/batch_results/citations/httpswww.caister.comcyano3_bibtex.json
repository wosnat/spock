The application of omics technologies to cyanobacterial research has yielded a wealth of new information. However for today's busy researchers, trawling through the literature to stay abreast of current developments can be extremely time-consuming. By compiling and summarising the most important topics on cyanobacterial omics and manipulation, the authors of this book provide the reader with a timely overview of the field.}\n}"
