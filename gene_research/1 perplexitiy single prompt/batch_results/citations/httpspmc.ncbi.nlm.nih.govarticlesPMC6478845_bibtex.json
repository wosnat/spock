Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences within promoters of target genes. A library of 322 signature-tagged gene deletion strains for 155 C. neoformans TF genes has been established. Previous phenome-based functional analysis of the C. neoformans TF mutant library identified key TFs important for various phenotypes, such as growth, differentiation, virulence-factor production, and stress responses. Here, utilizing the established TF mutant library, we identified 5 TFs that are important for radiation sensitivity, including SRE1, BZP2, GAT5, GAT6, and HCM1. Interestingly, BZP2, GAT5, and GAT6 all belong to the GATA-type transcription factors. These factors regulate transcription of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) sensitive genes when preferred nitrogen sources are absent or limiting. In addition to radiation, we found that specific GATA factors are important for other stressors such as rapamycin, fluconazole, and hydroxyurea treatment. Using real-time PCR method, we studied the expression of GATA down-stream genes after radiation exposure and identified that AAP4, AAP5, and URO1 were differentially expressed in the GAT5 and GAT6 mutants compared to the wild type cells. In summary, our data suggest that GATA TFs are important for radiation sensitivity in C. neoformans by regulating specific downstream AAP genes.}\n}\n```"
