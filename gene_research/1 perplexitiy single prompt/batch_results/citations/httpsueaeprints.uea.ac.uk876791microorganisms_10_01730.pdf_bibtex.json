Although most of the enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in chlorophototrophs are known, some are yet to be identified or fully characterized in certain organisms. A recently characterized enzyme in oxygenic phototrophs is 15-cis-zeta(\u03b6)-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO), which catalyzes the cis-to-trans isomerization of the central 15\u201315\u2032 cis double bond in 9,15,9\u2032-tri-cis-\u03b6-carotene to produce 9,9\u2032-di-cis-\u03b6-carotene during the four-step conversion of phytoene to lycopene. Z-ISO is a heme B-containing enzyme best studied in angiosperms. Homologs of Z-ISO are present in organisms that use the multi-enzyme poly-cis phytoene desaturation pathway, including algae and cyanobacteria, but appear to be absent in green bacteria. Here we confirm the identity of Z-ISO in the model unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by showing that the protein encoded by the slr1599 open reading frame has \u03b6-carotene isomerase activity when produced in Escherichia coli. A Synechocystis \u0394slr1599 mutant synthesizes a normal quota of carotenoids when grown under illumination, where the photolabile 15\u201315\u2032 cis double bond of 9,15,9\u2032-tri-cis-\u03b6-carotene is isomerized by light, but accumulates this intermediate and fails to produce \u2018mature\u2019 carotenoid species during light-activated heterotrophic growth, demonstrating the requirement of Z-ISO for carotenoid biosynthesis during periods of darkness. In the absence of a structure of Z-ISO, we analyze AlphaFold models of the Synechocystis, Zea mays (maize), and Arabidopsis thaliana enzymes, identifying putative protein ligands for the heme B cofactor and the substrate-binding site.}\n}\n```"
