A very direct use of these amino acids takes place in arginine biosynthesis, which starts with glutamate as precursor and in which another glutamate molecule, aspartate, and carbamoyl phosphate provide the three nitrogen atoms included in the guanidine group; carbamoyl phosphate is synthesized from glutamine, bicarbonate, and ATP. Given its high energetic demand, this pathway is usually subjected to feedback inhibition by arginine of one of its first enzymatic steps. In cyanobacteria, N-acetylglutamate kinase (NAGK) is inhibited by arginine, but under sufficient nitrogen, the C/N balance and energy status indicator P II protein (glnB gene product) binds to NAGK, relieving its inhibition by arginine, with the effect of increasing the production of arginine by the biosynthetic pathway. Bolay et al. now add another player to this regulatory system that they have identified in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis, the 51-amino-acid protein PirA. In response to ammonia upshifts, PirA binds to P II in an ADP-dependent manner, preventing binding of P II to NAGK and making this enzyme susceptible again to inhibition by arginine. Therefore, to fully understand the role of regulators such as PirA, further work on the physiology of arginine metabolism in cyanobacteria should address not only transitions between inorganic sources of nitrogen but also growth conditions in which arginine becomes available.}\n}\n```"
