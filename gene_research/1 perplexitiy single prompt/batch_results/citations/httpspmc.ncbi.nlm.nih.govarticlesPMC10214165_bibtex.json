PG biosynthesis is initiated in the cytoplasm through sequential reactions catalyzed by Mur enzymes that have been suggested to associate into a multimembered complex. This idea is supported by the observation that in many eubacteria, mur genes are present in a single operon within the well conserved dcw cluster, and in some cases, pairs of mur genes are fused to encode a single, chimeric polypeptide. We performed a vast genomic analysis using >140 bacterial genomes and mapped Mur chimeras in numerous phyla, with Proteobacteria carrying the highest number. MurE\u2013MurF, the most prevalent chimera, exists in forms that are either directly associated or separated by a linker. The crystal structure of the MurE\u2013MurF chimera from Bordetella pertussis reveals a head-to-tail, elongated architecture supported by an interconnecting hydrophobic patch that stabilizes the positions of the two proteins. Fluorescence polarization assays reveal that MurE\u2013MurF interacts with other Mur ligases via its central domains with KDs in the high nanomolar range, backing the existence of a Mur complex in the cytoplasm. These data support the idea of stronger evolutionary constraints on gene order when encoded proteins are intended for association, establish a link between Mur ligase interaction, complex assembly and genome evolution, and shed light on regulatory mechanisms of protein expression and stability in pathways of critical importance for bacterial survival.},\n    issn = {0027-8424},\n    doi = {10.1073/pnas.2219540120},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2219540120},\n    pmid = {37186837},\n    pmcid = {PMC10214165}\n}\n```"
