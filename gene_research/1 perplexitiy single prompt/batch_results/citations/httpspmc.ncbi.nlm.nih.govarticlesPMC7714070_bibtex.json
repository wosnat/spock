However, little is known about the mechanisms governing multiplanar cell division and morphogenesis. Here, we study the function of the prokaryotic cytoskeletal proteins, MreB and FtsZ in Fischerella muscicola PCC 7414 and Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 6912. Vancomycin and HADA labeling revealed a mixed apical, septal, and lateral trichome growth mode in F. muscicola, whereas C. fritschii exhibits septal growth. In all morphotypes from both species, MreB forms either linear filaments or filamentous strings and can interact with FtsZ. Furthermore, multiplanar cell division in F. muscicola likely depends on FtsZ dosage. Our results lay the groundwork for future studies on cytoskeletal proteins in morphologically complex cyanobacteria.}\n}\n```"
