The mutations lead to replacement of arginine with cysteine (p.Arg49Cys) and aspartic acid with glycine (p.Asp86Gly). Functional analysis of recombinant proteins containing the mutations detected showed that both dramatically reduce AHCY activity. The p.Arg49Cys mutant protein forms intermolecular disulphide bonds, leading to macromolecular structures that can be prevented by reducing agent DTT. The p.Asp86Gly protein tends to form enzymatically inactive aggregates and the loss of a single negative charge as a result of the mutation is involved in enzyme inactivation. We show that replacing Gly86 with negatively charged Glu86 in mutant protein restores enzymatic activity to 70% of wild-type, whereas changing Gly86 to positively charged Lys86 or uncharged Leu86 does not improve enzyme activity, indicating that the negative charge is important for maintenance of such activity. These studies significantly extend knowledge about the importance of residue 86 for AHCY activity. Residue 86 has not been implicated before in this way and the results suggest that the present model of S- adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolysis may need refinement. Our functional studies provide novel insight into the molecular defect underlying AHCY deficiency and reveal that both low enzyme activity and protein stability of AHCY contribute to the clinical phenotype.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.20985}\n}\n```"
