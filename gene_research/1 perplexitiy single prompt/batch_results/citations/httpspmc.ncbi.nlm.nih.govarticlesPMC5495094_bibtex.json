While the epoxyqueuosine reductase (EC 1.17.99.6) enzymatic activity was first described 30 years ago, the encoding gene queG was only identified in Escherichia coli in 2011. Interestingly, queG is absent from a large number of sequenced genomes that harbor Q synthesis or salvage genes, suggesting the existence of an alternative epoxyqueuosine reductase in these organisms. By analyzing phylogenetic distributions, physical gene clustering, and fusions, members of the Domain of Unknown Function 208 (DUF208) family were predicted to encode for an alternative epoxyqueuosine reductase. This prediction was validated with genetic methods. The Q modification is present in Lactobacillus salivarius, an organism missing queG but harboring the duf208 gene. Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is one of the few organisms that harbor both QueG and DUF208, and deletion of both corresponding genes was required to observe the absence of Q and the accumulation of oQ in tRNA. Finally, the conversion oQ to Q was restored in an E. coli queG mutant by complementation with plasmids harboring duf208 genes from different bacteria. Members of the DUF208 family are not homologous to QueG enzymes, and thus, duf208 is a non-orthologous replacement of queG. We propose to name DUF208 encoding genes as queH. While QueH contains conserved cysteines that could be involved in the coordination of a Fe/S center in a similar fashion to what has been identified in QueG, no cobalamin was identified associated with recombinant QueH protein. Queuosine (Q) is a complex modification of the base guanosine at the first position of tRNAs with the GUN anticodon (His, Tyr, Asn, and Asp). Q was discovered in the late 1960s, and its structure was established eight years later. The role of Q remained elusive for years, and there has been a renewed interest in this molecule, particularly as it appears to be a key micronutrient in humans. Q is found in eubacteria and eukaryotes, but only eubacteria are able to synthesize it. However, not all bacteria are capable of Q de novo synthesis, and several rely on salvage of Q precursor(s) for the presence of Q in their tRNA. Whether salvage or biosynthesis occurs, the tRNA-guanine (34) transglycosylase (EC 2.4.2.29), TGT, is the key enzyme in the pathway, as it is responsible for the exchange of guanine at position 34 of target tRNAs, with the precursor base preQ1. Two additional steps are required to finalize the synthesis. In the penultimate step, epoxyqueuosine (oQ) is synthesized by the S-adenosylmethionine ribosyltransferase-isomerase enzyme QueA (EC 2.4.99.17). The last step of the pathway is the conversion of oQ to Q. oQ was identified as an intermediate in the Q pathway in 1987. It was shown a year later, that the oQ reduction was performed by a cobalamine-dependent epoxyqueuosine reductase (EC 1.17.99.6) in Escherichia coli, at the time named QueB. It then took 25 years for the epoxyqueuosine reductase activity to be assigned to the yjeS gene, as a result of a systematic screen of the E. coli Keio collection, and the enzyme was renamed QueG. The QueG protein is homologous to B12-dependent iron\u2013sulfur proteins involved in halorespiration. In vitro activity was demonstrated with the Bacillus subtilis orthologous enzyme, and other studies confirmed the Fe/S cluster role and the cobalamin requirement including for the orthologous enzyme from Streptococcus thermophilus.}\n}\n```"
