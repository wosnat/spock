By analysis of the domain structure of the 1,171 potential histidine kinases, response regulators, and hybrid kinases, many various arrangements of about thirty different modules could be distinguished. The number of two-component proteins is related in part to genome size but also to the variety of physiological properties and ecophysiologies of the different strains. Groups of orthologues were defined, only a few of which have representatives with known physiological functions. Based on comparisons with the proposed phylogenetic relationships between the strains, the orthology groups show that (i) a few genes, some of them clustered on the genome, have been conserved by all species, suggesting their very ancient origin and an essential role for the corresponding proteins, and (ii) duplications, fusions, gene losses, insertions, and deletions, as well as domain shuffling, occurred during evolution, leading to the extant repertoire. These mechanisms are put in perspective with the different genetic properties that cyanobacteria have to achieve genome plasticity. This review is designed to serve as a basis for orienting further research aimed at defining the most ancient regulatory mechanisms and understanding how evolution worked to select and keep the most appropriate systems for cyanobacteria to develop in the quite different environments that they have successfully colonized.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.00046-05}\n}\n```"
