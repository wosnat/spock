Here, the synthesis of phycobiliprotein is confirmed to be much earlier than that of photosystem components during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis and an unknown protein Ssr1698 is discovered to be involved in this synthetic process. The unknown protein is further identified as a c-type heme oxygenase (cHO) in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway and catalyzes the opening of heme ring to form biliverdin IX\u03b1, which is required for phycobilin production and ensuing phycobiliprotein synthesis. In addition, the cHO-dependent phycobiliprotein is found to be vital for the growth of cyanobacterial cells during chlorosis and regreening through its nitrogen-storage and light-harvesting functions, respectively. Collectively, the cHO expressed preferentially during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis is identified in photosynthetic organisms and the dual function of this enzyme-dependent phycobiliprotein is proposed to be an important mechanism for acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment.}\n}\n```"
