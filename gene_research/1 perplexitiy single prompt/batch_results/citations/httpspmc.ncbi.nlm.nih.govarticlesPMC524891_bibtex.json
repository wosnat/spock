A product of the CysE reaction, OAS, can activate a subset of lacZ fusions to genes previously identified as being activated by cell-to-cell signaling. OAS and other cysteine metabolites can accumulate extracellularly in E. coli supernatants. However, this study demonstrates that although OAS can act as an activating signal, the actual signal in conditioned medium is unlikely to be either OAS or NAS and may represent a novel signal. Furthermore, we report that under our experimental conditions, a cysE mutant of E. coli formed biofilms at an accelerated rate relative to the wild type, suggesting a physiological role for CysE in controlling biofilm development.},\n    url = {https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC524891/}\n}\n```"
