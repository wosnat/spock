Water can be polluted by cyanide ions through wastewater effluents. In high concentrations, cyanide is considered a strong metabolic inhibitor and can cause inhibition in mitochondrial complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase), and its assimilation can result in chronic poisoning and/or acute poisoning to humans and animals. Bioremediation systems involving the usage of transgenic algal systems have become preferable alternatives for the detoxification of cyanide contamination due to the accumulation and the biosorbent efficiency of transgenic Chlamydomonas in the removal of KCNO from fresh water. The present study aimed to produce an ecofriendly bioremediation model to remediate cyanide pollution from a polluted marine system. An Agrobacterium-tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation technique was used to generate transformed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using plant expression vector pTRA-K-cTp carries isolated coding sequence of the cyanobacterial cyanase gene (CYN) isolated from Synechococcus elongatus (PCC6803). The transgenic C. reinhardtii strain (TC. reinhardtii-2) showed promising results for cyanide bioremediation in polluted water samples.},\n}\n```"
