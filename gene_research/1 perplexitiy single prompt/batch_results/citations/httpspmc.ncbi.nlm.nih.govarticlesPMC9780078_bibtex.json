In this context, for the development of novel inhibitors against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, UDP-N-Acetylmuramoyl-L-Alanine-D-Glutamate Ligase (MurD) enzyme represents one of the most apposite targets. The present review focuses on updated advancements on MurD-targeted inhibitors in recent years along with genetic regulation, structural and functional characteristics of the MurD enzyme from various bacterial pathogens. A concise account of various crystal structures of MurD enzyme, submitted into Protein Data Bank is also discussed.},\n    pmid = {36568273},\n    pmcid = {PMC9780078}\n}\n```"
