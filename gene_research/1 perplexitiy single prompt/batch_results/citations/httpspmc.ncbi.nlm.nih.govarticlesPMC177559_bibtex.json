Sequencing of the fragment revealed four putative open reading frames (ORFs), one of which (ORF-1) contained a partial sialyl motif including the amino acid sequence VGSKT, which is highly conserved among sialyltransferases. The gene was flanked by two inverted repeats containing the neisserial DNA uptake sequence and was preceded by a putative sigma 54 promoter. Database searches, however, revealed a high degree of homology between ORF-1 and the N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GlmU) of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and not with any known sialyltransferase. This homology was further established by the successful complementation of an orf-1 mutation by the E. coli glmU gene. Enzyme assays demonstrated that ORF-1 did not possess sialyltransferase activity but mimicked GlmU function catalyzing the conversion of N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which is a key metabolite in the syntheses of lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and sialic acids.}\n}\n```"
