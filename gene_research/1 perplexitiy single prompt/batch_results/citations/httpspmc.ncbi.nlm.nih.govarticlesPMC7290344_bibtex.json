Among them is the water-soluble neurotoxic non-protein amino acid beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), whose biological functions in cyanobacterial metabolism are of fundamental scientific and practical interest. An early BMAA inhibitory effect on nitrogen fixation and heterocyst differentiation was shown in strains of diazotrophic cyanobacteria Nostoc sp. PCC 7120, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (ATCC 29133), and Nostoc sp. strain 8963 under conditions of nitrogen starvation. Herein, we present a comprehensive proteomic study of Nostoc (also called Anabaena) sp. PCC 7120 in the heterocyst formation stage affecting by BMAA treatment under nitrogen starvation conditions. BMAA disturbs proteins involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolic pathways, which are tightly co-regulated in cyanobacteria cells. The presented evidence shows that exogenous BMAA affects a key nitrogen regulatory protein, PII (GlnB), and some of its protein partners, as well as glutamyl-tRNA synthetase gltX and other proteins that are involved in protein synthesis, heterocyst differentiation, and nitrogen metabolism. By taking into account the important regulatory role of PII, it becomes clear that BMAA has a severe negative impact on the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of starving Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 cells. BMAA disturbs carbon fixation and the carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism, photosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism. Stress response proteins and DNA repair enzymes are upregulated in the presence of BMAA, clearly indicating severe intracellular stress. This is the first proteomic study of the effects of BMAA on diazotrophic starving cyanobacteria cells, allowing a deeper insight into the regulation of the intracellular metabolism of cyanobacteria by this non-protein amino acid.}\n}\n```"
