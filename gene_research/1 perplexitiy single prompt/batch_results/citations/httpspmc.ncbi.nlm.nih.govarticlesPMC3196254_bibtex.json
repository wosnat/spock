The full-length cDNA sequence was 2031\u2009bp and contained 1755\u2009bp putative open reading frame which encodes a 584 amino acid deduced polypeptide whose computed molecular weight was 63.7\u2009kDa. Sequence homology research indicated that the nucleotide and putative protein had sequence identities of 72.5% and 69.5% with those of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the ZDS from C. protothecoides CS-41 had a closer relationship with those of chlorophyta and higher plants than with those of other species. In addition, we also found that the zds gene expression was upregulated in response to light.}\n}\n```"
