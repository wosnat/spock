In this study, we identified, cloned and sequenced a novel murA gene from an environmental isolate of Vibrio fischeri that is naturally resistant to fosfomycin. The fosfomycin resistance gene was isolated from a genomic DNA library of V. fischeri. An antimicrobial agent hypersensitive strain of Escherichia coli harbouring murA from V. fischeri exhibited a high fosfomycin resistance phenotype, with an MIC of 3000 \u00b5g/ml. The cloned murA gene was 1269 bp long encoding a 422 amino acid polypeptide with an estimated pI of 5.0. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative protein was identified as UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase by homology comparison. The MurA protein with an estimated molecular weight of 44.7 kDa was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. MurA of V. fischeri will be a useful target to identify potential inhibitors of fosfomycin resistance in pharmacological studies.}\n}\n```"
