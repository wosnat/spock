Lipopolysaccharides are the major component of the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane. We report here a frameshift mutation of the gene gmhD in the genome of S. sonnei 4351. The mutation results in a lack of epimerization of the core heptose while we also found increased thermosensitivity, abnormal cell division, and increased susceptibility to erythromycin and cefalexin compared to the S. sonnei 4303. Comparative genomic analysis supplemented with structural data helps us to understand the effect of specific mutations on the virulence of the bacteria and may provide an opportunity to study the effect of short lipopolysaccharides.}\n}\n```"
