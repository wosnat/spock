The PDS gene has been used as a selective marker for genome editing in several plant species, including banana (Musa spp.). Its knockout promotes dwarfism and albinism, characteristics that are easily recognizable and highly favorable. In Musa spp., the A genome increases fruit production and quality, whereas the B genome is associated with tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. The objective of this study was to identify a molecular marker in the PDS gene to easily discriminate the A and B genomes of banana. A 2166 bp fragment for the \u201cPDSMa\u201d marker was identified as polymorphic for the A genome (identification accuracy of 99.33%), whereas ~332 and ~225 bp fragments were detected for the \u201cPDSMb\u201d marker with 100% accuracy using MedCalc software. In this study, we used genotypes with A and B genomes that are used in the genetic improvement of bananas and an accession with the BT genome. It was not possible to differentiate the accession with the BT genome from the others, suggesting that the markers do not have the capacity to separate the T genome from the A and B genomes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use the PDS gene to determine doses of the A genome and identify the B genome in Musa spp., which will aid in evaluating the genomic constitution of banana hybrids and accessions at the seedling stage and accelerating their classification in crop genetic improvement programs.}\n}\n```"
