While transcriptional regulation has been studied in detail, the important role of the ribosome as an additional player in regulating gene expression is only beginning to emerge. Ribosome-interacting proteins are central to this translational regulation and include universally conserved ribosome interacting proteins, such as the ATPase YchF (Ola1 in eukaryotes). In both eukaryotes and bacteria, the cellular concentrations of YchF/Ola1 determine the ability to cope with different stress conditions and are linked to several pathologies in humans. The available data indicate that YchF/Ola1 regulates the stress response via controlling non-canonical translation initiation and via protein degradation. Although the molecular mechanisms appear to be different between bacteria and eukaryotes, increased non-canonical translation initiation is a common consequence of YchF/Ola1 regulated translational control in E. coli and H. sapiens. In this review, we summarize recent insights into the role of the universally conserved ATPase YchF/Ola1 in adapting translation to unfavourable conditions.}\n}\n```"
