Unlike the non-photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria have developed the sulfur utilization factor (SUF) mechanism as their main assembly pathway for Fe\u2013S clusters, supplemented by the iron\u2013sulfur cluster and nitrogen-fixing mechanisms. The SUF system consists of cysteine desulfurase SufS, SufE that can enhance SufS activity, SufBC2D scaffold complex, carrier protein SufA, and regulatory repressor SufR. The S source for the Fe\u2013S cluster assembly mainly originates from L-cysteine, but the Fe donor remains elusive. This minireview mainly focuses on the biogenesis pathway of the Fe\u2013S clusters in cyanobacteria and its relationship with iron homeostasis. Future challenges of studying Fe\u2013S clusters in cyanobacteria are also discussed.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00165}\n}\n```"
