Their regulatory roles in the motile and sessile lifestyles of P. putida have been investigated by generating single-, double-, and triple-null mutants and by overexpressing each protein (RsmA, RsmE, and RsmI) in different genetic backgrounds. The rsm triple mutant shows reduced swimming and swarming motilities and increased biofilm formation, whereas overexpression of RsmE or RsmI results in reduced bacterial attachment. However, biofilms formed on glass surfaces by the triple mutant are more labile than those of the wild-type strain and are easily detached from the surface, a phenomenon that is not observed on plastic surfaces. Analysis of the expression of adhesins and exopolysaccharides in the different genetic backgrounds suggests that the biofilm phenotypes are due to alterations in the composition of the extracellular matrix and in the timing of synthesis of its elements. We have also studied the expression patterns of Rsm proteins and obtained data that indicate the existence of autoregulation mechanisms.},\n    pmcid = {PMC5007770},\n    pmid = {27422830}\n}\n```"
