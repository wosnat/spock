Our results suggested that glucose is metabolized by these cyanobacteria, using primarily the oxidative pentoses and Calvin pathways, while no proof was found for the involvement of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway in this process. We observed differences in the effects of glucose availability, both between genera and between Prochlorococcus MED4 and SS120 strains, which might be related to their specific adaptations to the environment. We found evidence for fermentation in Prochlorococcus sp. strain SS120 and Synechococcus sp. strain WH8102 after 5\u2009mM glucose addition. Our results additionally suggested that marine cyanobacteria can detect nanomolar glucose concentrations in the environment and that glucose might be used to sustain metabolism under darkness. Furthermore, the KaiB and KaiC proteins were also affected in Synechococcus sp. WH8102, pointing to a direct link between glucose assimilation and circadian rhythms in marine cyanobacteria. In conclusion, our study provides a wide overview on the metabolic effects induced by glucose availability in representative strains of the diverse marine picocyanobacteria, providing further evidence for the importance of mixotrophy in marine picocyanobacteria.},\n    pmid = {36722960},\n    pmcid = {PMC10100731}\n}\n```"
