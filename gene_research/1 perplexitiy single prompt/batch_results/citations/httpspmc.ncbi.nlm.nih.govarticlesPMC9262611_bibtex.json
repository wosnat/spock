Although chloroplasts are descendants of endosymbiotic prokaryotes, the mechanism underlying this coupling in chloroplasts remains unclear. Here, we report transcription-translation coupling through AtNusG in chloroplasts. AtNusG is localized in chloroplast nucleoids and is closely associated with the chloroplast PEP complex by interacting with its essential component PAP9. It also comigrates with chloroplast ribosomes and interacts with their two components PRPS5 (uS5c) and PRPS10 (uS10c). These data suggest that the transcription and translation machineries are coupled in chloroplasts. In the atnusg mutant, the accumulation of chloroplast-encoded photosynthetic gene transcripts, such as psbA, psbB, psbC and psbD, was not obviously changed, but that of their proteins was clearly decreased. Chloroplast polysomic analysis indicated that the decrease in these proteins was due to the reduced efficiency of their translation in this mutant, leading to reduced photosynthetic efficiency and enhanced sensitivity to cold stress. These data indicate that AtNusG-mediated coupling between transcription and translation in chloroplasts ensures the rapid establishment of photosynthetic capacity for plant growth and the response to environmental changes. Therefore, our study reveals a conserved mechanism of transcription-translation coupling between chloroplasts and E. coli, which perhaps represents a regulatory mechanism of chloroplast gene expression.}\n}\n```"
