In Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803, inactivation of spermidine synthesis genes significantly reduced the survivability under chill (5\u00b0C)-light stress, and the survivability could be restored by addition of spermidine. To analyze the effects of spermidine on gene expression at 5\u00b0C, lacZ was expressed from the promoter of carboxy(nor)spermidine decarboxylase gene (CASDC) in Synechocystis. Our results indicate that spermidine promotes gene expression and replacement of damaged proteins in cyanobacteria under the chill-light stress in winter. This is the first report on the role of polyamines in survival of overwintering cyanobacteria.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00153-15},\n    pmcid = {PMC4524183},\n    pmid = {25917915}\n}\n```"
