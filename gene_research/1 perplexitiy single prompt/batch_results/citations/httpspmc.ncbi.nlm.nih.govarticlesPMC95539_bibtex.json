Here we show that the proposed Escherichia coli ortholog, RlmB (formerly YjfH), indeed is essential for the formation of Gm in position 2251 of 23S rRNA. However, a \u0394rlmB mutant did not show any ribosome assembly defects and was not outgrown by a wild-type strain even after 120 cell mass doublings. Thus, RlmB has no important role in ribosome assembly or function in E. coli.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.183.23.6957-6960.2001}\n}\n```"
