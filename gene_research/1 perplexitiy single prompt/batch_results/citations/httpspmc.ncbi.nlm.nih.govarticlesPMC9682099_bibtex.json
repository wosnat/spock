To make possible the rational exploitation of these microorganisms, it is fundamental to know their metabolic capabilities and to have genomic resources. In this context, the main objective of this research was to determine the genome features and the biochemical profile of Synechococcus sp. UCP002. The cyanobacterium was isolated from the Peruvian Amazon Basin region and cultured in BG-11 medium. Growth parameters, genome features, and the biochemical profile of the cyanobacterium were determined using standardized methods. Synechococcus sp. UCP002 had a specific growth rate of 0.086 \u00b1 0.008 \u03bc and a doubling time of 8.08 \u00b1 0.78 h. The complete genome of Synechococcus sp. UCP002 had a size of \u223c3.53 Mb with a high coverage (\u223c200x), and its quality parameters were acceptable (completeness = 99.29%, complete and single-copy genes = 97.5%, and contamination = 0.35%). Additionally, the cyanobacterium had six plasmids ranging from 24 to 200 kbp. The annotated genome revealed \u223c3,422 genes, \u223c 3,374 protein-coding genes (with \u223c41.31% hypothetical protein-coding genes), two CRISPR Cas systems, and 61 non-coding RNAs. Both the genome and plasmids had the genes for prokaryotic defense systems. Additionally, the genome had genes coding the transcription factors of the metalloregulator ArsR/SmtB family, involved in sensing heavy metal pollution. The biochemical profile showed primary nutrients, essential amino acids, some essential fatty acids, pigments (e.g., all-trans-\u03b2-carotene, chlorophyll a, and phycocyanin), and phenolic compounds. In conclusion, Synechococcus sp. UCP002 shows biotechnological potential to produce human and animal nutrients and raw materials for biofuels and could be a new source of genes for synthetic biological applications.}\n}\n```"
