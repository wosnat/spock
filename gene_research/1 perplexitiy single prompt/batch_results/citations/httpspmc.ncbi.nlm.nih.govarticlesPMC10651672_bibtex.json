To study their role(s) in cyanobacteria, we investigated a collection of 11 completely segregated spk mutants among the 12 annotated Spks in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Screening of the mutant collection revealed that especially the mutant defective in SpkB encoded by slr1697 showed clear deviations regarding carbon metabolism, that is, reduced growth rates at low CO2 or in the presence of glucose, and different glycogen accumulation patterns compared to WT. Alterations in the proteome of \u0394spkB indicated changes of the cell surface but also metabolic functions. A phospho-proteome analysis revealed the absence of any phosphorylation in two proteins, while decreased phosphorylation of the carboxysome-associated protein CcmM and increased phosphorylation of the allophycocyanin alpha subunit ApcA was detected in \u0394spkB. Furthermore, the regulatory PII protein appeared less phosphorylated in the mutant compared to WT, which was verified in Western blot experiments, indicating a clearly delayed PII phosphorylation in cells shifted from nitrate-containing to nitrate-free medium. Our results indicate that SpkB is an important regulator in Synechocystis that is involved in phosphorylation of the PII protein and additional proteins.},\n    pmid = {37797745},\n    pmcid = {PMC10651672}\n}\n```"
