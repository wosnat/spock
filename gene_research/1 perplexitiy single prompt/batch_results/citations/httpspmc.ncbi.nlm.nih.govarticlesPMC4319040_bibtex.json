The D1 protein of PSII, encoded by the psbA gene, provides multiple ligands for cofactors crucial to this enzymatic reaction. Cyanobacteria contain multiple psbA genes that respond to various physiological cues and environmental factors. Certain unicellular cyanobacterial cells, such as Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142, are capable of nitrogen fixation, a highly oxygen-sensitive process, by separating oxygen evolution from nitrogen fixation using a day-night cycle. We have shown that c-psbA4, one of the five psbA orthologs in this cyanobacterium, is exclusively expressed during nighttime. Remarkably, the corresponding D1 isoform has replacements of a number of amino acids that are essential ligands for the catalytic Mn4CaO5 metal center for water oxidation by PSII. At least 30 cyanobacterial strains, most of which are known to have nitrogen fixing abilities, have similar psbA orthologs. We expressed the c-psbA4 gene from Cyanothece 51142 in a 4E-3 mutant strain of the model non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, which lacks any psbA gene. The resultant strain could not grow photoautotrophically. Moreover, these Synechocystis 6803 cells were incapable of PSII-mediated oxygen evolution. Based on our findings, we have named this physiologically relevant, unusual D1 isoform sentinel D1. Sentinel D1 represents a new class of D1 protein that, when incorporated in a PSII complex, ensures that PSII cannot mediate water oxidation, thus allowing oxygen-sensitive processes such as nitrogen fixation to occur in cyanobacterial cells.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M114.604124}\n}\n```"
