In bacteria such two forms of the enzyme are known (genes cysK and cysM). CysK differs from CysM in that it can also use sulphide instead of thiosulphate, to produce cysteine instead of cysteine thiosulphonate. This entry represents CysK-type cysteine synthases. It includes beta-cyanoalanine synthase, a mitochondrial cysteine synthase-like protein from plants.}\n}"
