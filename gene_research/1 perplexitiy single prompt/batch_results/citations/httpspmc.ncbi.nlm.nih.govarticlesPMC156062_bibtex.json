One unexpected difference is that the circadian autoregulatory feedback loop in cyanobacteria does not require specific clock gene promoters as it does in eukaryotes, because a heterologous promoter can functionally replace the kaiBC promoter. On the other hand, a similarity between eukaryotic clock proteins and the cyanobacterial KaiC protein is that KaiC is phosphorylated in vivo. The other essential clock proteins KaiA and KaiB modulate the status of KaiC phosphorylation; KaiA inhibits KaiC dephosphorylation and KaiB antagonizes this action of KaiA. Based upon an analysis of clock mutants, we conclude that the circadian period in cyanobacteria is determined by the phosphorylation status of KaiC and also by the degradation rate of KaiC. These observations are integrated into a model proposing rhythmic changes in chromosomal status.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdg168}\n}\n```"
