The \u03c3 factors are responsible for recognizing and unwinding promoter DNA in all bacterial RNAPs. Here, we report two cryo-EM structures of cyanobacterial transcription initiation complexes at near-atomic resolutions. The structures show that cyanobacterial RNAP forms an \u201cSI3-\u03c3\u201d arch interaction between domain 2 of \u03c3 A (\u03c3 2 ) and sequence insertion 3 (SI3) in the mobile catalytic domain Trigger Loop (TL). The \u201cSI3-\u03c3\u201d arch facilitates transcription initiation from promoters of different classes through sealing the main cleft and thereby stabilizing the RNAP-promoter DNA open complex. Disruption of the \u201cSI3-\u03c3\u201d arch disturbs cyanobacteria growth and stress response. Our study reports the structure of cyanobacterial RNAP and a unique mechanism for its transcription initiation.},\n    pmid = {37036976},\n    pmcid = {PMC10120043}\n}\n```"
