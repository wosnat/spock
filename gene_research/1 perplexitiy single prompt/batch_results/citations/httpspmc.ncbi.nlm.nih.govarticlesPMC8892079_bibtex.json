Reflecting the importance of this molecule, defects in heme biosynthesis underlie several blood disorders in humans. Aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) initiates heme biosynthesis in \u03b1-proteobacteria and nonplant eukaryotes. Debilitating and painful diseases such as X-linked sideroblastic anemia and X-linked protoporphyria can result from one of more than 91 genetic mutations in the human erythroid-specific enzyme ALAS2. This review will focus on recent structure-based insights into human ALAS2 function in health and how it dysfunctions in disease. We will also discuss how certain genetic mutations potentially result in disease-causing structural perturbations. Furthermore, we use thermodynamic and structural information to hypothesize how the mutations affect the human ALAS2 structure and categorize some of the unique human ALAS2 mutations that do not respond to typical treatments, that have paradoxical in vitro activity, or that are highly intolerable to changes. Finally, we will examine where future structure-based insights into the family of ALA synthases are needed to develop additional enzyme therapeutics.}\n}\n```"
