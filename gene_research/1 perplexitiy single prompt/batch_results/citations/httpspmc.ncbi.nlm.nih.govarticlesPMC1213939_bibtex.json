Previously, hisG mutants were mapped into seven intervals defined by the available deletion mutations having endpoints in the hisG gene. The map has been refined using over 60 new deletion mutants. The new map divides the gene into 40 deletion intervals, which average approximately 30 base pairs in length. The map has been used to analyze the distribution of insertion sites for the transposable element Tn 10 and has permitted conclusions on the distribution of duplication endpoints. The map promises to be useful in analysis of his regulation and, more particularly, in the determination of the possible role of the hisG enzyme in this mechanism.},\n    url = {https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1213939/}\n}\n```"
