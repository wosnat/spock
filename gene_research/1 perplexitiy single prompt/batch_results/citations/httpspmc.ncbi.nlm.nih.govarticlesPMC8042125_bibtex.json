Therefore, cyanobacteria have evolved a sophisticated signal transduction network targeting the metabolite 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), the carbon skeleton for nitrogen assimilation. It serves as a status reporter for the cellular C/N balance that is sensed by transcription factors NtcA and NdhR and the versatile PII-signaling protein. The PII protein acts as a multitasking signal-integrating regulator, combining the 2-OG signal with the energy state of the cell through adenyl-nucleotide binding. Depending on these integrated signals, PII orchestrates metabolic activities in response to environmental changes through binding to various targets. In addition to 2-OG, other status reporter metabolites have recently been discovered, mainly indicating the carbon status of the cells. One of them is cAMP, which is sensed by the PII-like protein SbtB. The present review focuses, with a main emphasis on unicellular model strains Synechoccus elongatus and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, on the physiological framework of these complex regulatory loops, the tight linkage to metabolism and the molecular mechanisms governing the signaling processes.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/femsre/fuz025},\n}\n```"
