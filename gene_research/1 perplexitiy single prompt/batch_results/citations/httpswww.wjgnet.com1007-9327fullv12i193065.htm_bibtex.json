METHODS: One-week-old animals carrying HBV x gene and their wild-type littermates were intraperitoneally (ip) injected with either single-dose AFB1 [6 mg/kg body weight (bw)], repeated-dose cyanotoxins (microcystin-LR or nodularin, 10 \u03bcg/kg bw once a week for 15 wk), DMSO (vehicle control) alone, or AFB1 followed by cyanotoxins a week later, and were sacrificed at 24 and 52 wk post-treatment. RESULTS: AFB1 induced liver tumors in 13 of 29 (44.8%) transgenic mice at 52 wk post-treatment, significantly more frequent than in wild-type mice (13.3%). This significant difference was not shown in the 24-wk study. Compared with AFB1 exposure alone, MC-LR and nodularin yielded approximately 3-fold and 6-fold increases in the incidence of AFB1-induced liver tumors in wild-type animals at 24 wk, respectively. HBV x gene did not further elevate the risk associated with co-exposure to AFB1 and cyanotoxins. CONCLUSION: HBV x gene and nodularin promote the development of AFB1-induced liver tumors. Co-exposure to AFB1 and MC-LR tends to elevate the risk of liver tumors at 24 wk relative to exposure to one of them. The combinative effect of AFB1, cyanotoxins and HBVx on hepatotumorigenesis is weak at 24 wk.}\n}\n```"
