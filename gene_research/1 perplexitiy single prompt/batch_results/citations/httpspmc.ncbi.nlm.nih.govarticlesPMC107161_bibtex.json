The transcription of galE is not influenced by galactose but is repressed by glucose. Galactose is toxic for galE-negative bacteria because it results in elevated levels of metabolic intermediates. These negative effects are reduced in galK and galT mutants. Glucose is also toxic for galE-negative strains. Bacillus subtilis 168 is unable to use sugars such as lactose, galactose, and xylose as its sole carbon source. This is surprising given the fact that genes which encode the proteins necessary for the degradation of lactose and xylose are present in B. subtilis and that these genes are expressed under inducing conditions. We cloned and sequenced a B. subtilis homolog of the Escherichia coli galE gene. Meanwhile, the complete B. subtilis genome has been sequenced. Besides the galE homolog, putative galK and galT genes have been identified. Again, the genetic equipment of the bacterium should allow the utilization of galactose as the sole carbon source, but nevertheless galactose does not support growth. We were therefore interested in whether the B. subtilis galE gene serves any function. We were able to prove that the gene is expressed in B. subtilis 168. The transcription is not influenced by galactose but is repressed in the presence of glucose. Galactose is not actively transported into B. subtilis 168. Even minor amounts of internal UDP-galactose are toxic for galE-negative B. subtilis strains. Glucose is able to alleviate the effects of galactose but causes cell death during late log phase. One task of the GalE protein is therefore to protect the cell from the toxic effects of galactose and glucose or derivatives of both sugars which accumulate in its absence.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/jb.180.8.2265-2270.1998}\n}\n```"
