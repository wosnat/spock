However, temperature-sensitive recAts polA cells grow well upon induction of DNA damage and supplementation with catalase at restrictive temperatures. These treatments reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which suggests that recAts polA cells are susceptible to ROS, but not chronic chromosome damage. Therefore, we investigated whether polA cells can tolerate a complete lack of recombinase function. We introduced a \u0394recA allele in polA cells in the presence or absence of the hslO -encoding redox molecular chaperon Hsp33 expression plasmid. Induction of the hslO gene with IPTG resulted in increased cell viability in \u0394recA polA cells with the hslO expression plasmid. \u0394recA polA cells in the absence of the hslO expression plasmid showed rich medium sensitivity with increasing ROS levels. Adding catalase to the culture medium considerably rescued growth arrest and decreased ROS. These results suggest that hslO expression manages oxidative stress to an acceptable level in cells with oxidative damage and rescues cell growth. Overall, ROS may regulate several processes, from damage response to cell division, via ROS-sensitive cell metabolism.}\n}\n```"
