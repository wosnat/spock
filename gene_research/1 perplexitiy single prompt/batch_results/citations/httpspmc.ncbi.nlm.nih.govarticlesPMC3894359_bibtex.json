PCC 6803. Three genes in the operon encode low-oxygen-type enzymes to bypass three oxygen-dependent reactions in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. A chlR -lacking mutant, \u0394 chlR , shows poor photoautotrophic growth due to low chlorophyll (Chl) content under low-oxygen conditions, which is caused by no induction of the operon. Here, we characterized the processes of etiolation of \u0394 chlR cells in low-oxygen conditions and the subsequent regreening of the etiolated cells upon exposure to oxygen, by HPLC, Western blotting, and low-temperature fluorescence spectra. The Chl content of the etiolated \u0394 chlR cells incubated under low-oxygen conditions for 7 days was only 10% of that of the wild-type with accumulation of almost all intermediates of the magnesium branch of Chl biosynthesis. Both photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) were significantly decreased, accompanied by a preferential decrease of antenna Chl in PSI. Upon exposure to oxygen, the etiolated \u0394 chlR cells resumed to produce Chl after a short lag (\u223c2 h), and the level at 72 h was 80% of that of the wild-type. During this novel \u201coxygen-induced\u201d greening process, the PSI and PSII contents were largely increased in parallel with the increase in Chl contents. After 72 h, the PSI content reached \u223c50% of the wild-type level in contrast to the full recovery of PSII. \u0394 chlR provides a promising alternative system to investigate the biogenesis of PSI and PSII.}\n}\n```"
