Here, we describe the analysis of lspA, encoding a putative SPase II, an essential component of lipoprotein processing in gram-negative bacteria, from Rickettsia typhi. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences shows the presence of highly conserved residues and domains that are essential for SPase II activity in lipoprotein processing. The transcription of lspA, lgt (encoding prolipoprotein transferase), and lepB (encoding type I signal peptidase), monitored by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, reveals a differential expression pattern during various stages of rickettsial intracellular growth. The higher transcriptional level of all three genes at the preinfection time point indicates that only live and metabolically active rickettsiae are capable of infection and inducing host cell phagocytosis. lspA and lgt, which are involved in lipoprotein processing, show similar levels of expression. However, lepB, which is involved in nonlipoprotein secretion, shows a higher level of expression, suggesting that LepB is the major signal peptidase for protein secretion and supporting our in silico prediction that out of 89 secretory proteins, only 14 are lipoproteins. Overexpression of R. typhi lspA in Escherichia coli confers increased globomycin resistance, indicating its function as SPase II. In genetic complementation, recombinant lspA from R. typhi significantly restores the growth of temperature-sensitive E. coli Y815 at the nonpermissive temperature, supporting its biological activity as SPase II in prolipoprotein processing. Rickettsiae are gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacteria that are transmitted to their mammalian hosts by arthropod vectors such as ticks, fleas, and lice. Some members of the genus Rickettsia are responsible for the most-severe bacterial diseases of humans and have been classified as select agents with potential use as tools for bioterrorism. Currently, diagnosis of rickettsial infections is difficult. No reliable protective vaccine and only a few antibiotics to treat rickettsiae are available. Little is known about rickettsial gene function because of the intrinsic difficulty in working with these obligate intracellular bacteria and their genetic intractability. The genomes of several rickettsial species have been sequenced and have provided many insights into their biology; however, the molecular basis of pathogenesis remains an important area of research for rickettsiae. Several bacterial virulence factors point to the importance of secreted proteins in pathogenesis. Secreted and extracytoplasmic proteins are of particular importance, because this subset of proteins are involved in many essential cellular processes, including adherence, virulence, immunogenicity, environmental sensing, and host-pathogen interactions, and are potential targets of therapeutic interest. The major route of bacterial protein secretion from the cytoplasm is the Sec pathway. Bacterial proteins transported through the Sec translocon are synthesized as preproteins with an amino-terminal extension known as the signal or leader peptide. The signal peptide is required for the targeting of preproteins to the membrane for translocation by Sec machinery. During the translocation process, the signal peptides of nonlipoproteins are cleaved off by the type I signal peptidase (SPase I), while those of lipoproteins are cleaved off by the type II signal peptidase (SPase II). Thus, SPases play a key role in the transport of proteins across membranes in all organisms. The major difference between signal peptides of lipoproteins and nonlipoproteins is the presence of a conserved consensus sequence called a \u201clipobox\u201d of four amino acids in lipoprotein signal peptides. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the lipobox is a universally conserved cysteine at position +1. The cysteine residue of the lipobox is modified by diacylglyceryl transferase (Lgt). Diacylglyceryl modification is a prerequisite for the specific cleavage of the signal peptide from prolipoprotein by SPase II. Like the SPase I family, SPase II members are membrane-bound proteases. Type II signal peptidases have been identified in many gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including Mycoplasma. However, SPase II has not been found in archaea or eukaryotes. Lipoprotein processing by SPase II has been reported to be essential for the viability of gram-negative bacteria, but it has been shown to be dispensable for the growth of many gram-positive bacteria. Processing of lipoproteins by SPase II plays an important role in the virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and has been shown to be critical for the intracellular growth of many bacterial pathogens. In addition, bacterial lipoproteins are reported to initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses in humans. Based on these findings, LspA, a membrane-bound protease, is considered an attractive target for chemotherapy. The annotation of published rickettsial genome sequences reveals the presence of bacterial Sec translocon homologs. However, the genes specifically involved in rickettsial protein secretion remain uncharacterized. In order to elucidate the mechanism of protein secretion and their role in rickettsial virulence, we are interested in characterizing the genes involved in the rickettsial Sec pathway. In this effort, we reported our work on the putative lepB and secA genes, encoding the SPase I and ATPase, respectively, of rickettsiae. In this communication, we report a detailed transcriptional and functional characterization of lspA, which encodes a putative SPase II from Rickettsia typhi, the causative agent of murine typhus.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.01397-06},\n}\n```"
