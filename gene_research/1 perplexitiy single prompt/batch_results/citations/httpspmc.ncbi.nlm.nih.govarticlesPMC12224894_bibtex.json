They exist in a variety of environments and have been used extensively as model organisms for studies of photosynthesis and environmental adaptation. Lysine acetylation (Kac), a widespread and evolutionarily conserved protein posttranslational modification, is reversibly catalyzed by lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) and lysine deacetylases (KDACs). Over the past decade, a growing number of acetylated proteins have been identified in cyanobacteria, and Kac is increasingly recognized as having essential roles in many cellular processes, such as photosynthesis, energy metabolism, and stress responses. Recently, cGNAT2 and CddA were identified as KAT and KDAC in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, respectively. The identified Kac regulatory enzymes provide novel insight into the mechanisms that globally regulate photosynthesis in cyanobacteria and potentially other photosynthetic organisms. This review summarizes recent progress in our understanding of the functions and mechanisms of lysine acetylation in Cyanobacteria. The challenges and future perspectives in this field are also discussed.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1042/BST20241037},\n}\n```"
