However, oxygen was absent from the earth\u2019s atmosphere for close to half of its lifespan. When the earth was formed around 4.5 billion years ago, it had vastly different conditions. At that time, the earth had a reducing atmosphere, consisting of carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor, as opposed to the present-day atmosphere that consists primarily of nitrogen and oxygen. Though sunlight split the water vapor in the atmosphere into oxygen and hydrogen, the oxygen quickly reacted with methane and got locked into the earth\u2019s crust, barely leaving any traces in the atmosphere. A silent, mysterious force worked to release oxygen steadily, until the very composition of the atmosphere changed. That mysterious entity happened to be a microbe: Cyanobacteria. The release of oxygen by cyanobacteria was thus responsible for changes in the earth\u2019s atmospheric composition, the rise of aerobic metabolism and, ultimately, the evolution of multicellularity. Oxygen is the primary molecule that makes Earth what it is today, far more hospitable and beautiful than the early earth. It is certainly no exaggeration to say that we owe our existence in present form to cyanobacteria.},\n    url = {https://asm.org/articles/2022/february/the-great-oxidation-event-how-cyanobacteria-change},\n}\n```"
