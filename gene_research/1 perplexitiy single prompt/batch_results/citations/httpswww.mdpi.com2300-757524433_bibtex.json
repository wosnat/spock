The widespread presence of cyanobacteria in aquatic environments exposes them to antibiotic contamination. Cyanobacteria are also in direct contact with pathogenic bacteria containing antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs), which impart these characteristics to them. This study aims to examine the presence of some ARGs in locally isolated cyanobacteria species, Spirulina laxa, Chroococcus minutes, Oscillatoria princeps, Oscillatoria proteus, Oscillatoria terebriformis, and Lyngbya epiphytica, and compare the presence of these genes in two pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ampicillin (Ap) and erythromycin (Em) resistance genes were detected in five algal samples. Meanwhile, Chloramphenicol (Cm) and gentamicin (Gm) resistance genes were apparent in only two species. Genes encoding resistance towards kanamycin (Km) and spectinomycin (Sp) were recorded in three specimens. It was also found that E. coli possessed resistance genes for four antibiotics, ampicillin (Ap), erythromycin (Em), gentamicin (Gm), and kanamycin (Km), whereas K. pneumoniae was resistant towards three antibiotics, ampicillin (Ap), gentamicin (Gm), and kanamycin (Km). The results show that there is a match in antibiotic-resistance genes in both cyanobacteria and pathogenic bacteria. Suggesting the possibility that cyanobacteria could acquire ARGs from the environment through horizontal gene transfer. Thus, freshwater cyanobacteria may play a significant role in the prevalence of ARGs in their environment.}\n}\n```"
