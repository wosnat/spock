Although many RPs are essential for survival, genome analysis demonstrates the absence of some RP genes in many bacterial and archaeal genomes. Furthermore, global transposon mutagenesis and/or targeted deletion studies showed that elimination of some RP genes had only a moderate effect on the bacterial growth rate. Here, we systematically analyzed the evolutionary conservation of RPs in prokaryotes by compiling a list of the ribosomal genes that are missing from one or more genomes in the recently updated version of the Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COG) database. Some of these absences occurred because the respective genes carried frameshifts, presumably resulting from sequencing errors, while others were overlooked and not translated during genome annotation. Apart from these annotation errors, we identified multiple genuine losses of RP genes in a variety of bacteria and archaea. Some of these losses are clade specific, whereas others occur in symbionts and parasites with dramatically reduced genomes. The lists of computationally and experimentally defined nonessential ribosomal genes show a substantial overlap, revealing a common trend in prokaryote ribosome evolution that could be linked to the architecture and assembly of the ribosomes. Thus, RPs that are located at the surface of the ribosome and/or are incorporated at a late stage of ribosome assembly are more likely to be nonessential and to be lost during microbial evolution, particularly in the course of genome compaction.}\n}\n```"
