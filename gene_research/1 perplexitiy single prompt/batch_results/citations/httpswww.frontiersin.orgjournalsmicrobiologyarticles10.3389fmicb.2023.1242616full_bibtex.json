The photosynthesis machinery is particularly susceptible to environmental changes and adaptation to them often involves redox-sensing proteins that are the targets of reactive oxygen species generated by photosynthesis activity. Here we show that EngA, an essential GTPase and ribosome-assembly protein involved in ribosome biogenesis in bacteria and chloroplasts, also plays a role in acclimatization to environmentally relevant stress in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 and that PipX, a promiscuous regulatory protein that binds to EngA, appears to fine-tune EngA activity. During growth in cold or high light conditions, the EngA levels rise, with a concomitant increase of the EngA/PipX ratio. However, a sudden increase in light intensity turns EngA into a growth inhibitor, a response involving residue Cys122 of EngA, which is part of the GD1-G4 motif NKCES of EngA proteins, with the cysteine conserved just in the cyanobacteria-chloroplast lineage. This work expands the repertoire of ribosome-related factors transmitting redox signals in photosynthetic organisms and provides additional insights into the complexity of the regulatory interactions mediated by EngA and PipX.}\n}\n```"
