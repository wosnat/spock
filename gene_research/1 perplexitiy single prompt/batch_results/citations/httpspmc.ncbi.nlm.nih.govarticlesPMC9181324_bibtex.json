In prokaryotes, a functional molecular clock has been defined only in cyanobacteria. Here, we investigated the presence of circadian rhythms in non-cyanobacterial prokaryotes. The bioinformatic approach was used to identify a homologue of KaiC (circadian gene in cyanobacteria) in Escherichia coli. Then, strains of E. coli (wild type and mutants) were grown on blood agar, and sampling was made every 3 h for 24 h at constant conditions. Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR, and the rhythmicity was analyzed using the Cosinor model. We identified RadA as a KaiC homologue in E. coli. Expression of radA showed a circadian rhythm persisting at least 3 days, with a peak in the morning. The circadian expression of other E. coli genes was also observed. Gene circadian oscillations were lost in radA mutants of E. coli. This study provides evidence of molecular clock gene expression in E. coli with a circadian rhythm. Such a finding paves the way for new perspectives in antibacterial treatment.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23116136}\n}\n```"
