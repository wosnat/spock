Here, a versatile gene replacement system without this restriction is reported in a unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942. The system is based upon the dominance of a streptomycin-sensitive rps12 gene encoding a ribosomal S12 protein over a streptomycin-resistant rps12-R43 allele with a Lys-43\u2192\u2192\u2192Arg substitution. To demonstrate the utility of this method, a cassette consisting of the wild-type rps12 gene and a kan gene conferring kanamycin resistance was integrated into the rps12-R43 mutant at the psbAI locus encoding photosystem II D1 protein, resulting in streptomycin-sensitive merodiploids. Despite spontaneous gene conversion in these merodiploids to produce streptomycin-resistant progeny at frequencies ranging from 1\u00d710 \u22125 to 5\u00d710 \u22125 , homologous recombination could be induced by transforming the merodiploids with template plasmids carrying psbAI 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 non-coding sequences flanking the D1 coding sequence, which was then replaced by either the gfp ORF for a green fluorescent protein or a precise deletion. Depending on the replication ability of the template plasmids, at most 3\u201316% of streptomycin-resistant progeny of the merodiploids after transformation were homogenote recombinants with concomitant loss of the kan gene, even in these polyploid cyanobacteria. The rps12 -mediated gene replacement thus makes it possible to construct mutants free from drug resistance markers and opens a way to create cyanobacterial strains bearing an unlimited number of gene replacements.}\n}\n```"
