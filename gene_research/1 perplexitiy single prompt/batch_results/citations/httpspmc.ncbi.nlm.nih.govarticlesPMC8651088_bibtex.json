To fully utilize their industrial potency, it is critical to understand their photosynthetic efficiency under various environmental conditions. In this study, we elucidated the inhibitory mechanisms of photosynthesis under high-light and low-temperature stress conditions in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Under each stress condition, the transcript abundance and translation efficiency were measured using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling, and the genome-wide transcription unit architecture was constructed by data integration of transcription start sites and transcript 3\u2032-end positions obtained from differential RNA-seq and sequencing of 3\u2032-ends (Term-seq), respectively. Our results suggested that the mode of photosynthesis inhibition differed between the two stress conditions; high light stress induced photodamage responses, while low temperature stress impaired the translation efficiency of photosynthesis-associated genes. In particular, poor translation of photosystem I resulted from ribosome stalling at the untranslated regions, affecting the overall photosynthetic yield under low temperature stress. Our comprehensive multiomics analysis with transcription unit architecture provides foundational information on photosynthesis for future industrial strain development.}\n}\n```"
