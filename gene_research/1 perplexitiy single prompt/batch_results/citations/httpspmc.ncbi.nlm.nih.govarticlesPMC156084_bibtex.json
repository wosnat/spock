We quantitatively analyzed the intracellular dynamics of these proteins and found a circadian rhythm in the membrane/cytosolic localization of KaiB, such that KaiB interacts with a KaiA\u2013KaiC complex during the late subjective night. KaiB\u2013KaiC binding is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in KaiC phosphorylation and followed by dissociation of the clock protein complex(es). KaiB attenuated KaiA-enhanced phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo. Based on these results, we propose a novel role for KaiB in a regulatory link among subcellular localization, protein\u2013protein interactions and post-translational modification of Kai proteins in the cyanobacterial clock system.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1093/emboj/cdg212}\n}\n```"
