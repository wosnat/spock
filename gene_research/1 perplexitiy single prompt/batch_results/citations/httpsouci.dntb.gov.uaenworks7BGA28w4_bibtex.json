Additionally, lipid molecules associate with membrane proteins and impact their structures and functions. In both cyanobacteria and the chloroplasts of plants and algae, the lipid bilayer of the thylakoid membrane consists of four distinct glycerolipid classes: monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, and phosphatidylglycerol. These lipids are also integral components of photosynthetic complexes such as photosystem II and photosystem I. The lipid-binding sites within the photosystems, as well as the lipid composition in the thylakoid membrane, are highly conserved between cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes, and each lipid class has specific roles in oxygenic photosynthesis. This review aims to shed light on the potential evolutionary implications of lipid utilization in membrane lipid bilayers and photosynthetic complexes in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms.}\n}\n```"
