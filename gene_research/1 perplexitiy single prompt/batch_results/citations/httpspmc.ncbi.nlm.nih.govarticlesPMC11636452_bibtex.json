While the timing of the evolution of superoxide dismutases (SODs), enzymes that convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and O2, within bacteria and archaea is not resolved, the first SODs appearing in cyanobacteria contained copper and zinc in the reaction center (CuZnSOD). Here, we analyse growth characteristics, SOD gene expression (qRT\u2010PCR) and cellular enzyme activity in the deep branching strain, Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367, previously demonstrated to release significantly more O2 under anoxic conditions. The observed significantly higher growth rates (p < 0.001) and protein and glycogen contents (p < 0.05) in anoxically cultured Pseudanabaena PCC7367 compared to control cultures grown under present\u2010day oxygen\u2010rich conditions prompted the following question: Is the growth of Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367 correlated to atmospheric pO2 and cellular SOD activity? Expression of sodB (encoding FeSOD) and sodC (encoding CuZnSOD) strongly correlated with medium O2 levels (p < 0.001). Expression of sodA (encoding MnSOD) correlated significantly to SOD activity during the day (p =\u20090.019) when medium O2 concentrations were the highest. The cellular SOD enzyme activity of anoxically grown cultures was significantly higher (p < 0.001) 2\u2009h before the onset of the dark phase compared to O2\u2010rich growth conditions. The expression of SOD encoding genes was significantly reduced (p < 0.05) under anoxic conditions in stirred cultures, as were medium O2 levels (p \u2264 0.001), compared to oxic\u2010grown cultures, whereas total cellular SOD activity remained comparable. Our data suggest that increasing pO2 negatively impacts the viability of early cyanobacteria, possibly by increasing photorespiration. Additionally, the increased expression of superoxide\u2010inactivating genes during the dark phase suggests the increased replacement rates of SODs under modern\u2010day conditions compared to those on early Earth.},\n    url = {https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.70005},\n    pmid = {39665522},\n    pmcid = {PMC11636452}\n}\n```"
